# VoiceCoach V2 Testing Orchestrator Instructions

## Overview
You will act as an automated testing orchestrator for the VoiceCoach V2 desktop app, validating WebSocket transcription functionality, LED breadcrumb systems, and real-time coaching features. This approach replaces traditional automated testing with Claude-orchestrated functional validation.

---

## 🎯 Core Testing Principle
**Test ACTUAL real-time functionality, not just UI mechanics**
- Validate that WebSocket connections work end-to-end
- Check quality of real-time transcription and coaching
- Ensure all LED breadcrumb chains complete successfully
- Never mark as "PRODUCTION READY" without testing live audio/transcription flow
- Focus on <200ms coaching response time requirement

---

## 🔄 Autonomous Correction Loop

### When Tests Fail
If any test fails, Claude should attempt autonomous correction:

```markdown
1. Analyze failure pattern:
   - Check LED chain for last successful step
   - Identify component that failed (WebSocket, Audio, UI)
   - Determine if auto-fixable

2. Deploy targeted fix:
   - For connection issues: Check Socket.IO configuration
   - For audio issues: Verify microphone permissions
   - For server issues: Restart Python WebSocket server  
   - For UI issues: Check React state management

3. Re-test after fix:
   - Repeat failed test phase
   - Validate LED chain progression
   - Check performance improvement

4. Escalate if needed:
   - After 3 failed attempts
   - Document specific blockers
   - Request human intervention
```

### Maximum Iterations
- Connection tests: 5 attempts
- Audio pipeline tests: 3 attempts (requires system permissions)
- Quality improvement: 10 iterations
- Each iteration should show measurable improvement

## 🛠️ Helper Functions for Testing

### Capture Console LEDs
```javascript
// Use mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages to get all console output
// Filter for LED patterns to track VoiceCoach V2 progress
async function captureVoiceCoachLEDs() {
  const messages = await mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages();
  const ledPattern = /🎵\s+LED\s+(\d+):|❌\s+LED\s+(\d+)\s+FAILED/;
  return messages
    .filter(msg => ledPattern.test(msg))
    .map(msg => {
      const match = msg.match(ledPattern);
      const ledNum = parseInt(match[1] || match[2]);
      const isError = msg.includes('FAILED');
      return { 
        led: ledNum, 
        message: msg, 
        isError,
        timestamp: Date.now()
      };
    });
}
```

### Validate WebSocket LED Sequence
```javascript
// Check that expected WebSocket LED sequence occurred
function validateWebSocketLEDs(captured) {
  const expectedSequence = [6010, 7010, 7011, 7030, 6020];
  const capturedLEDs = captured.map(item => item.led);
  
  for (const expectedLED of expectedSequence) {
    if (!capturedLEDs.includes(expectedLED)) {
      return {
        success: false,
        missing: expectedLED,
        lastSeen: capturedLEDs[capturedLEDs.length - 1],
        sequence: capturedLEDs
      };
    }
  }
  return { success: true, sequence: capturedLEDs };
}
```

### Monitor Transcription Performance
```javascript
// Watch for transcription completion and measure timing
async function measureTranscriptionLatency(timeout = 10000) {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const startLED = 6040; // Starting microphone capture
  const endLED = 6041;   // Final transcript
  
  while (Date.now() - startTime < timeout) {
    const leds = await captureVoiceCoachLEDs();
    const hasStart = leds.some(led => led.led === startLED);
    const hasEnd = leds.some(led => led.led === endLED);
    
    if (hasStart && hasEnd) {
      const startTime = leds.find(led => led.led === startLED).timestamp;
      const endTime = leds.find(led => led.led === endLED).timestamp;
      return { 
        success: true, 
        latency: endTime - startTime,
        meetsRequirement: (endTime - startTime) < 500 
      };
    }
    
    // Check for errors
    const errors = leds.filter(led => led.isError);
    if (errors.length > 0) {
      return { 
        success: false, 
        error: errors[0].message 
      };
    }
    
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  }
  return { success: false, error: "Timeout waiting for transcription" };
}
```

---

## 🎯 Critical Validation Rules

1. **NEVER accept UI without backend functionality** - test the complete flow
2. **ALWAYS verify LED chains complete successfully** - incomplete chains = broken features
3. **TEST real-time performance requirements** - <200ms coaching, <500ms transcription
4. **VALIDATE WebSocket protocol compliance** - proper Socket.IO handshakes
5. **RUN error scenario testing** - network failures, permission denials
6. **AUTO-FIX when possible** - but escalate WebSocket/audio issues quickly
7. **REPORT with LED evidence** - include complete breadcrumb trails

## Final Testing Mantra

**VoiceCoach V2 is ONLY successful when:**
- ✅ Real-time audio transcription works end-to-end
- ✅ WebSocket connection stable and performant  
- ✅ Coaching suggestions appear within <200ms
- ✅ Complete LED breadcrumb chains validate (1000→6099→7011→6050)
- ✅ Error recovery works without crashes
- ✅ Session management reliable and clean
- ✅ DevTools accessible for troubleshooting

**Remember**: You're testing REAL-TIME FUNCTIONALITY that sales professionals depend on. The goal is to ensure the app provides immediate, actionable coaching that helps in live sales conversations, not just that buttons work.
