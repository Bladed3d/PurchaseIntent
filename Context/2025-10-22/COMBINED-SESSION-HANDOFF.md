## Primary Goal

Build an AI-powered "synthetic focus group" system that predicts consumer purchase likelihood by simulating hundreds of virtual customers, delivering quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback in minutes at 12,000x lower cost than traditional human focus groups while achieving 7-12% higher accuracy.

---

## Key Decisions (All Sessions Combined)

**Core Architecture:**
1. Use Agents not Skills - Agents = explicit user invocation; Skills = model auto-invokes
2. 5-agent modular architecture - Agent 0 (Topic Research) → Agent 1 (Product Research) → Agent 2 (Demographics) → Agent 3 (Personas) → Agent 4 (ParaThinker Intent Simulator)
3. Human-in-the-loop design - 4 checkpoints for validation (not fully automated)
4. Free/low-cost data sources - Reddit (PRAW), YouTube API v3, Playwright scraping for Amazon
5. Triangulation validation - Cross-validate demographics from 3+ sources (78-85% accuracy)
6. LED breadcrumb instrumentation - Ranges 500-4599 for debugging across all 5 agents
7. ParaThinker integration - 8 parallel reasoning paths to eliminate tunnel vision
8. SSR (Semantic Similarity Rating) - Avoid unrealistic rating distributions
9. Persona reusability - Agent 3 personas test unlimited products (most valuable asset)
10. Zero marginal cost model - Use Claude Code subscription ($0 per test during beta)

**Process Improvements (Sessions 20:46 + 21:22):**
11. Anti-Over-Engineering Protocol added to CLAUDE.md - Forces minimal solutions first, get approval, iterate UP
12. PRD-Simplifier subagent created - Creates minimal bullet-point PRDs (<100 lines) to save time/money
13. Session-Summarizer agent created - Extracts actionable decisions from long chat sessions (<200 lines)
14. /end-session command created - Automates handoff summary creation
15. Git workflow added to CLAUDE.md - Document versioning protocol to prevent data loss

**Documentation Created (Session 21:22):**
16. PRD created - Docs/PRD-Purchase-Intent-System.md (170 lines, approved for development)
17. SSR Implementation Summary - Docs/SSR-Implementation-Summary.md (detailed SSR methodology)
18. Context workflow established - Session handoff templates and protocols

## Explicitly Ruled Out

**From Research:**
- Twitter/X API free tier - Too limited (1,500 tweets/month), not viable without paid tier
- Pushshift API - Shut down for public use as of 2024
- Goodreads API - Deprecated since Dec 2020, no new keys issued
- Amazon official API (PA-API) - Review text not available, requires 3 sales within 180 days
- Fully automated pipeline - Must keep human checkpoints for validation and transparency
- Skills-based architecture - Would auto-trigger; need explicit agent invocation for control
- Naive LLM rating prompts - "Rate 1-5" creates unrealistic distributions (95% say "4")

**Process Anti-Patterns:**
- Building all 5 agents at once (too complex)
- Creating elaborate architecture docs without user approval (30+ min wasted)
- Editing documents in place instead of versioning
- Over-engineered PRDs with sections user didn't request
- Enterprise-scale solutions for simple apps

---

## Blockers / Open Questions

**Resolved:**
- Git repository NOW initialized (per current environment: "Is directory a git repo: Yes")
- Document versioning protocol added to CLAUDE.md
- Over-engineering problem solved with anti-engineering protocol + PRD-simplifier agent
- Session continuity problem solved with session-summarizer agent + handoff system

**Technical:**
- [ ] Amazon scraping reliability - Aggressive anti-bot detection, requires 5-10 sec delays + stealth plugins
  - Mitigation: ScraperAPI free tier (1,000 requests/month) as fallback
- [ ] Reddit Pushshift API unavailable - Historical data access lost, limited to ~1,000 recent results via PRAW
- [ ] Twitter/X free tier too limited - Only 1,500 tweets/month, may need to skip Twitter entirely

**Validation:**
- [ ] Human survey data for benchmarking - Need real human responses to validate Agent 4 (ParaThinker) output
  - Target: 85-90% correlation
  - May need to conduct small human survey (PickFu ~$50/test) for ground truth

---

## Critical Context

### Architecture Evolution: 4 Agents → 5 Agents

**Original Design (v1.1 - Lost):**
- 4 agents only: Product Researcher → Demographics Analyst → Persona Generator → ParaThinker Simulator
- User provides product idea directly to Agent 1
- LED ranges: 1000-4099

**Current Design (v2.0):**
- Added Agent 0: Topic Research Agent (discovers high-demand ebook topics)
- New workflow: USER NICHE → Agent 0 → User selects topic → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Agent 4
- LED ranges shifted: 500-599 (Agent 0), 1500-1599 (Agent 1), 2500-2599 (Agent 2), 3500-3599 (Agent 3), 4500-4599 (Agent 4)
- Adds Checkpoint 0 (user reviews/selects from 5-10 ranked topics)

**Rationale for Agent 0:**
- Implements Brian Moran's "Rule of One" strategy for ebook topic discovery
- Validates demand BEFORE spending time on product research
- Uses same ParaThinker 8-path approach for comprehensive topic analysis
- Zero marginal cost (same Claude Code subscription)
- Estimated time: 15 minutes to research 5-10 topics

### Cost Model: Zero Marginal Cost

**Beta Phase Strategy:**
- Deploy as in-house service using Claude Code subscription
- $0 per product test (unlimited testing within subscription)
- Contrast with original estimate: $1.05-1.15 per first run, $0.50 per reuse
- Future option: API-based SaaS with metered pricing (if scaling beyond personal use)

**Traditional Comparison:**
- Human focus group: $5,000-20,000 per product
- Our system: $0 (beta) or $1.15 (if metered)
- Savings: 12,000x - infinite during beta

### Accuracy Claims

**SSR (Semantic Similarity Rating):**
- 90% correlation with human responses (from research)
- Achieves realistic rating distributions (KS similarity >0.85)
- Avoids naive LLM problem where 95% say "4"

**ParaThinker Parallel Reasoning:**
- 7-12% accuracy boost vs sequential reasoning
- Eliminates tunnel vision (70% conformity in human focus groups)
- 8 independent paths: VALUE, FEATURES, EMOTIONS, RISKS, SOCIAL PROOF, ALTERNATIVES, TIMING, TRUST

**Overall System:**
- Target: 85-90% accuracy (validated against human survey data)
- Requires ground truth validation (may need PickFu ~$50 for benchmark)

### Hidden Segment Discovery

**Key Innovation from Research:**
- Subreddit overlap analysis reveals underserved niches
- Example: r/productivity → r/ADHD (8.7× overlap) = 22% of audience
- Agent 1 discovers these segments, Agent 4 tests them separately
- Result: "ADHD professionals: 4.12/5 intent (HIGHEST) - Target this segment first"

### Deployment Model: Claude Code Agents

**Why Agents (not Skills):**
- Agents = Explicit user invocation → Full control over when they run
- Skills = Model auto-invokes → Would trigger unexpectedly, less predictable
- Use case requires deliberate sequential execution (Agent 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
- Human checkpoints between each agent (validation/approval workflow)

**Implementation:**
- Create 5 separate agent configurations in .claude/agents/
- Each agent has custom system prompt, tool permissions, LED breadcrumb range
- User explicitly invokes: `/agent0 research-topics`, `/agent1 find-products`, etc.
- Data handoff via JSON files in data/research-sessions/{session_id}/

### Critical Lessons Learned

**Document Versioning:**
- ALWAYS create new files (e.g., 4-agents-design-v2.md or 5-agents-design.md)
- NEVER edit original documents in place
- User lost 4-agent design v1.1 because Claude edited in place instead of versioning
- Session ended with user frustration: "Good bye!"
- RESOLVED: Git workflow now documented in CLAUDE.md

**Session Memory:**
- Claude has no memory between sessions
- User explicitly called out: "No you won't do it right the next time because it will be a different chat"
- Must rely on CLAUDE.md project instructions and session handoff documents
- RESOLVED: Session-summarizer agent + handoff system now in place

**Over-Engineering Problem:**
- Claude defaults to enterprise-scale solutions
- Example: 30+ minutes creating elaborate 4-agent architecture doc
- User frustrated: "I have to pay for every token... Claude is frivolous and foolish in engineering a spaceship when we only need a bicycle"
- RESOLVED: Anti-over-engineering protocol in CLAUDE.md + PRD-simplifier agent

**Git Version Control:**
- Project NOW has git repository initialized (confirmed)
- No version control = lost work when documents overwritten
- Critical for multi-session project work
- RESOLVED: Git workflow documented in CLAUDE.md

### MVP Timeline (5 Weeks)

**Phase 0 (Week 1):**
- Build Agent 0: Topic Research Agent
- Deliverable: Working topic discovery + ranking system with HTML dashboard

**Phase 1 (Weeks 2-3):**
- Build Agent 1: Product Researcher (comparables, subreddit overlap)
- Build Agent 2: Demographics Analyst (triangulation, confidence scoring)
- Build Agent 3: Persona Generator (500 synthetic customers, JSON storage)
- Deliverable: Reusable persona inventory (80%+ confidence)

**Phase 2 (Weeks 4-5):**
- Build Agent 4: ParaThinker Intent Simulator
- Implement 8-path parallel reasoning
- Implement SSR (Semantic Similarity Rating)
- Psychographic conditioning (personas think differently)
- Deliverable: Full 5-agent pipeline (85-90% accuracy target)

---

## Success Criteria

**Technical:**
- All 5 agents operational with LED breadcrumb instrumentation
- 85-90% correlation with human survey responses (Agent 4 validation)
- Zero marginal cost operation (Claude Code subscription only)
- Persona reusability working (test 100 products with same 500 personas)
- 4 human checkpoints functional (user validation at each stage)

**Business:**
- Faster than human focus groups (35 min vs 2-4 weeks = 672× faster)
- Cheaper than human focus groups (free vs $5,000-20,000 = infinite savings during beta)
- More perspectives (4,000 reasoning paths vs 10-20 people = 200× more)
- Zero tunnel vision (parallel paths vs 70% human conformity)
- Higher accuracy (85-90% vs 60-70% human bias = +25% better)

**User Acceptance:**
- Topic discovery works (Agent 0 finds high-demand ebook topics)
- Demographics feel accurate (Agent 2 confidence >80%)
- Personas feel realistic (Agent 3 diversity and psychographic conditioning)
- Intent predictions actionable (Agent 4 recommendations clear and specific)
- Hidden segments discovered (subreddit overlap reveals opportunities)
