**Purpose:** Consolidated handoff document tracking all session decisions from today
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23 (Session Summarizer Agent)

## Session: session-15-37-17.md

**Source:** `D:\Projects\Ai\Purchase-Intent\Context\2025-10-23\session-15-37-17.md`
**Processed:** 2025-10-23

### Primary Goal
Fix prd-collaboration-specialist agent to prevent automatic agent launching and enable proper Terminal 2 research workflow.

### Decisions Made

1. **Agent Behavior Fixed**: Updated prd-collaboration-specialist agent to NEVER use Task tool to launch other agents
   - Added CRITICAL section forbidding Task tool usage
   - Agent now only generates copy/paste prompts for user to launch in Terminal 2
   - Prevents unwanted automatic agent launches during collaboration

2. **Workflow Pattern Established**: Human launches research agents manually in Terminal 2
   - Collaboration agent provides formatted prompts
   - User copies prompts to Terminal 2 when needed
   - Collaboration continues while research runs in parallel

3. **Agent Instructions Enhanced**: Added three levels of reinforcement
   - Line 3: Agent description explicitly states "NEVER launches other agents"
   - Lines 12-19: New CRITICAL section with DO/DON'T lists
   - Line 143: Workflow reminder reinforces no Task tool usage

### Ruled Out
- Allowing prd-collaboration-specialist to auto-launch research agents (tried, didn't work as expected)
- Single-terminal workflow (parallel research required)

### Artifacts Created
- **Modified:** `.claude/agents/prd-collaboration-specialist.md` - Fixed to prevent agent launching

### Next Actions
1. Start new chat session to run prd-collaboration-specialist with fixes
2. Deploy on: `D:\Projects\Ai\Purchase-Intent\Docs\PRD-Purchase-Intent-System.md`
3. Complete PRD v2.0 through collaborative refinement

### Blockers / Open Questions
- [ ] Need to verify gh55 (user note)
- [ ] Awaiting PRD v2.0 completion before proceeding to team review

## Session: session-17-17-34.md

**Source:** `D:\Projects\Ai\Purchase-Intent\Context\2025-10-23\session-17-17-34.md`
**Processed:** 2025-10-23

### Primary Goal
Execute PRD collaboration Phase 1-3 to generate PRD v2.0, then run Curtis-style multi-agent team review.

### Decisions Made

#### PRD Collaboration (5 Questions Answered)

1. **LED Breadcrumb Ranges (Q1)**: Follow PRD ranges (500-4599 agent-specific blocks)
   - Agent 0: 500-599
   - Agent 1: 1500-1599
   - Agent 2: 2500-2599
   - Agent 3: 3500-3599
   - Agent 4: 4500-4599
   - CLAUDE.md will be updated to document Purchase Intent System ranges

2. **Agent 0 Data Sources (Q2)**: MVP uses free tier APIs only
   - **Included:** Reddit (PRAW API), YouTube (YouTube Data API v3), Google Trends (pytrends)
   - **Deferred post-MVP:** Amazon scraping, X/Twitter API, TikTok/BookTok
   - Rationale: Based on Grok research findings (Docs/Grok-Book-data.md)

3. **Agent 4 Performance Targets (Q3)**: Accuracy over speed
   - Target runtime: 20-25 minutes
   - 400 personas x 8 parallel paths = 3,200 perspectives (reduced from 4,000)
   - Rationale: Diminishing returns beyond 400 personas (<2% accuracy gain for 40% more compute)

4. **Slash Command Implementation (Q4)**: Claude Code custom commands pattern
   - Use `.claude/commands/*.md` files
   - Commands expand to prompts instructing Claude to execute Python agents
   - Reuses existing pattern from `end-session.md` and `context-summary.md`

5. **Agent 2 Confidence Calculation (Q5)**: Hybrid model with checkpoint gates
   - Formula: Agreement Score x Data Quality Weight
   - <80% confidence = FAIL checkpoint (user must approve to continue)
   - Prevents error propagation to downstream agents
   - Target: 85-90% accuracy vs human focus groups' 60-70%

#### Team Review Execution

6. **Curtis Pattern Deployed**: Created prd-team-review agent and executed multi-agent review
   - Deployed 5 specialist agents in parallel: Lead Programmer, Breadcrumbs Agent, UI Designer, Testing Agent, Project Manager
   - Each agent wrote concerns to separate files in `Docs/agent-reviews/`
   - Synthesized final review summary

7. **LED Range Alignment Issue Identified**: CLAUDE.md had conflicting ranges
   - CLAUDE.md stated: 1000-9099 (generic system)
   - PRD v2.0 stated: 500-4599 (Purchase Intent specific)
   - Decision: Update CLAUDE.md to document Purchase Intent System uses 500-4599

### Ruled Out
- Using CLAUDE.md generic ranges (1000-9099) for Purchase Intent System
- Including paid/complex APIs in MVP (Amazon, Twitter, TikTok)
- Optimizing beyond 400 personas (diminishing returns)

### Artifacts Created

**PRD Collaboration:**
- **Created:** `Docs/PRD-Purchase-Intent-System-v2.md` - Complete refined specification with all 5 decisions integrated

**Team Review:**
- **Created:** `Docs/agent-reviews/lead-programmer-concerns.md`
- **Created:** `Docs/agent-reviews/breadcrumbs-agent-concerns.md`
- **Created:** `Docs/agent-reviews/ui-designer-concerns.md`
- **Created:** `Docs/agent-reviews/testing-agent-concerns.md`
- **Created:** `Docs/agent-reviews/project-manager-concerns.md`
- **Created:** `Docs/PRD-v2-TEAM-REVIEW-SUMMARY.md` - Consolidated findings from all 5 agents
- **Created:** `.claude/agents/prd-team-review.md` - New orchestrator agent for Curtis pattern reviews
- **Created:** `Docs/SSR-Implementation-Summary.md` - Technical implementation details

**Improved Agent:**
- **Modified:** `.claude/agents/prd-collaboration-specialist.md` - Enhanced with better workflow instructions

### Ready to Build
- PRD v2.0 complete and team-reviewed
- All 5 specialist agents provided implementation feedback
- LED breadcrumb ranges defined and documented
- API strategy clarified (free tier only for MVP)
- Performance targets established
- Confidence calculation methodology specified

### Blockers / Open Questions
- [ ] CLAUDE.md needs update to document Purchase Intent System LED ranges (500-4599)
- [ ] Need to decide: Start implementation immediately or address team review concerns first?
- [ ] Git commit needed for all new documentation (PRD v2.0, agent reviews, new agents)

### Next 3 Actions

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** - Add Purchase Intent System LED ranges documentation
   - Add section documenting 500-4599 ranges for 5 agents
   - Clarify that different projects can use different range allocations
   - Location: CLAUDE.md LED Breadcrumb System section

2. **Review Team Feedback** - Read `Docs/PRD-v2-TEAM-REVIEW-SUMMARY.md`
   - Identify critical concerns requiring PRD updates
   - Identify implementation guidance to follow
   - Decide if PRD v2.1 needed or proceed with v2.0

3. **Git Commit Session Work** - Commit all artifacts created today
   - Stage: PRD v2.0, team review files, new agents, SSR summary
   - Commit message: "PRD v2.0 collaborative refinement and team review"
   - Push to GitHub main branch

### Key References
- **PRD v2.0:** `Docs/PRD-Purchase-Intent-System-v2.md`
- **Team Review Summary:** `Docs/PRD-v2-TEAM-REVIEW-SUMMARY.md`
- **Agent Reviews:** `Docs/agent-reviews/*.md` (5 files)
- **Collaboration Agent:** `.claude/agents/prd-collaboration-specialist.md`
- **Team Review Agent:** `.claude/agents/prd-team-review.md`
- **SSR Implementation:** `Docs/SSR-Implementation-Summary.md`

## For Next Session

**Start by reading this handoff, then ask user:**

"I see PRD v2.0 is complete and team-reviewed. Three paths forward:

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** with Purchase Intent LED ranges (500-4599) - quick task
2. **Review team feedback** from `Docs/PRD-v2-TEAM-REVIEW-SUMMARY.md` - determine if PRD v2.1 needed
3. **Start implementation** - Begin building Agent 0 based on current PRD v2.0

Which would you like to tackle first?"
