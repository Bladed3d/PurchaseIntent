# Session Handoff: 2025-10-24

**Session file:** `Context/2025-10-24/session-00-22-23.md`
**Duration:** ~2-3 hours
**Status:** Tier 2 rate limit strategy implemented, drill-down feature implemented, critical competition scoring bug discovered

---

## Primary Goal
Implement Tier 2 rate limit management (queue manager + dashboard indicators) and drill-down feature for finding "Rule of One" specific niches, without jumping to complex Playwright scraping solution.

---

## Key Decisions Made This Session

### Rate Limit Strategy (Tier 2)
1. **Implement Tier 2 first, not Tier 3 (Playwright)** - Test enhanced queuing before committing to 4-6 hours of Playwright complexity
2. **Queue manager with batch safety checks** - Pre-flight validation before executing batches, user warnings/confirmations if exceeding limits
3. **Dashboard rate limit indicator** - Real-time tracking: Green (0-5 calls/hr), Yellow (6-10), Red (11+), updates every 5 seconds
4. **API call history tracking** - All queries logged to `cache/api_call_history.json` (cached vs actual API calls)
5. **Batch time estimates** - Show users: "20 topics = ~7 minutes" with cache hit predictions

### Drill-Down Feature Implementation
6. **Use Grok's AI methodology** - Web search + social signals + composite scoring (Trends 50% + Reddit 25% + X/Twitter 25%)
7. **Two-mode approach** - Claude AI with web research (for Anthropic API users) + pattern-based fallback (no API needed)
8. **Pattern-based is sufficient for MVP** - User already pays for Claude (no need for separate Anthropic API), pre-defined patterns work well for common niches
9. **CLI flag implementation** - `--drill-down "topic"` generates 10 subtopics, then researches all with Agent 0
10. **Reuse existing Agent 0 logic** - No separate research pipeline needed, just generate subtopics then feed to main()

---

## Explicitly Ruled Out

1. **Playwright scraping (Tier 3)** - Too complex (4-6 hours, 400+ lines, proxy management, ethical concerns) without proving Tier 2 insufficient first
2. **Separate Anthropic API subscription** - User already pays for Claude, pattern-based fallback is cost-effective
3. **Real-time API endpoint** - Avoided Flask/FastAPI complexity for MVP, CLI-based approach sufficient
4. **Hard-coded fake data for testing** - All test data from real API calls, cached appropriately

---

## Artifacts Created

### New Files
- **`agents/agent_0/queue_manager.py`** (260 lines) - Smart batch processing, rate limit tracking, API call history management
- **`agents/agent_0/drill_down.py`** (300+ lines) - AI-powered subtopic generation using Grok's methodology, pattern-based fallback for common topics
- **`cache/api_call_history.json`** - API call tracking database (timestamp, keyword, cached status, source)

### Modified Files
- **`agents/agent_0/dashboard.py`** - Added rate limit indicator JavaScript (updateRateLimitIndicator function, auto-updates every 5s), queue_manager integration for API history injection
- **`agents/agent_0/api_clients.py`** - Integrated queue_manager logging for cache hits and actual API calls
- **`agents/agent_0/main.py`** - Added batch safety checks, time estimates, --drill-down CLI flag, API usage summary output
- **`.env`** - Added comments about optional ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for drill-down AI mode

---

## Ready to Build

### Completed and Tested
- Queue manager with batch time estimation working
- Rate limit indicator functional (tracks 0-15 calls/hour limit)
- Dashboard JavaScript updates every 5 seconds with current status
- API call history logging (cache hits vs actual calls)
- Drill-down feature functional with pattern-based fallback
- CLI integration: `python agents/agent_0/main.py --drill-down "romance novels"`

### Test Results - 4 Topics
- Total queries: 5
- Actual API calls: 2 (40%)
- Cache hits: 3 (60%)
- Rate limit usage: 2/15 calls (13% - SAFE)
- Quality score: 100% (60 LEDs, 0 failures)
- Time estimate accuracy: Predicted 28.2s, actual ~30s

### Test Results - Drill-Down (10 Romance Subtopics)
- Successfully generated 10 subtopics using pattern fallback
- Researched all 10 with demand/competition scores
- API usage: 10/15 calls (67% - CAUTION)
- Quality score: 100% (130 LEDs, 0 failures)
- Handled rate limit 429 errors with automatic retry/backoff

---

## CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED

### Competition Score Quantization Issue

**Problem:** Competition scores are quantized to only a few values (43.33, 50.0, 70.0, 56.67) causing topics to stack vertically on dashboard instead of scattering naturally.

**Root Cause:**
- All topics hitting same sample limits (20 YouTube videos, 50 Reddit posts)
- YouTube: 20 videos → base_competition = 40 (always)
- Reddit: 50 posts (sample limit) → always similar scores
- Formula: `(20 + 80 + 50) / 3 = 50` or `(20 + 80 + 40) / 3 = 43.33`

**Impact:**
- Dashboard visualization misleading (vertical line of bubbles)
- Cannot differentiate between subtopics with similar competition
- Drill-down feature reveals limitation of current scoring

**Example (Drill-Down Test):**
```
enemies to lovers romance: Competition 43.33
contemporary romance novels: Competition 50.0
billionaire romance novels: Competition 70.0
historical regency romance: Competition 43.33
paranormal romance novels: Competition 43.33
second chance romance: Competition 43.33
small town romance: Competition 43.33
sports romance novels: Competition 43.33
military romance novels: Competition 43.33
office romance novels: Competition 50.0
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Sampling artifact (not real competitive differences)
- Need more granular metrics beyond just counts
- Current scoring too simplistic for drill-down analysis

**Not Fixed Yet** - Session ended with bug discovered but not resolved

---

## Blockers / Open Questions

### High Priority
- [ ] **Fix competition score quantization** - Need to add granularity: engagement quality, recency distribution, channel diversity, trend direction (not just binary rising/falling)
- [ ] **Dashboard drill-down button** - JavaScript integration needed (currently CLI-only), trigger Python subprocess, show progress, update chart
- [ ] **Decide on competition fix approach** - Option A: Add more factors to scoring algorithm, Option B: Document limitation for broad comparisons only, Option C: Both

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Stress test Tier 2** - Run 20-topic batch to validate queue manager handles real workload
- [ ] **Drill-down breadcrumb navigation** - UI for "All Topics > romance novels > 10 subtopics" navigation tree
- [ ] **Add more pattern templates** - Currently only 4 topics (romance, meditation, cooking, productivity)

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Evaluate need for Tier 3 (Playwright)** - Only if Tier 2 stress test shows >10% failure rate
- [ ] **Consider Anthropic API integration** - If user wants AI-generated subtopics for any topic (not just patterns)
- [ ] **Real-time progress indicator** - For long drill-down operations (currently silent during processing)

---

## Next 3 Actions

1. **Fix Competition Score Quantization Bug**
   - File: `agents/agent_0/competition_analyzer.py`
   - Add granular factors: engagement rate (views/video), recency score (weighted by age), diversity index (unique channels/posts)
   - Test with same 10 romance subtopics to verify scores spread naturally
   - Expected outcome: Bubbles scatter across dashboard instead of vertical line
   - Time estimate: 1-2 hours

2. **Implement Dashboard Drill-Down Button Integration**
   - File: `agents/agent_0/dashboard.py`
   - Add click handler for drill-down button
   - Trigger Python subprocess: `python agents/agent_0/main.py --drill-down "{topic}"`
   - Show progress indicator, poll for results file, update chart when complete
   - Expected outcome: One-click drill-down from dashboard UI
   - Time estimate: 1.5-2 hours

3. **Stress Test Tier 2 with 20 Topics**
   - Test batch safety checks, queue manager estimates, rate limit handling
   - Monitor: cache hit rate, 429 error rate, total time vs estimate
   - Success criteria: <3 failures, >60% cache hits, completes in <30 mins
   - Decision point: If >10% failure rate, proceed to Tier 3 (Playwright), else Tier 2 sufficient
   - Time estimate: 30 minutes

## Technical Details

### Tier 2 Rate Limit Implementation

**Queue Manager Features:**
```python
queue_manager.can_process_batch(topics)  # Pre-flight safety check
queue_manager.estimate_batch_time(topics)  # Time + cache prediction
queue_manager.get_calls_last_hour()  # Current usage stats
queue_manager.log_api_call(keyword, cached=True/False)  # Track all calls
queue_manager.export_for_dashboard()  # JavaScript injection
```

**Dashboard Rate Indicator:**
- localStorage key: `agent0_api_calls`
- Auto-updates every 5 seconds
- Status: Green (0-5), Yellow (6-10), Red (11+) out of 15/hour limit
- Shows: "X/15 API calls last hour | Next safe: Ys | Cache: Z hits (W%)"

**Batch Safety Checks:**
```
[*] Batch Estimate:
  Total topics: 4
  Cached: 2 | New queries: 2
  Estimated time: ~0.5 min (28.2s)

[!] WARNING: Would exceed rate limit (18/15 calls)
Recommendations:
  - Reduce batch size by 3 topics
  - Or wait for call history to roll past 1-hour window
  - Current rate limit usage: 15/15 calls
  - Cache is helping: 60.0% hit rate
```

### Drill-Down Implementation

**Grok's Methodology (Claude AI Mode):**
1. Brainstorm 15-25 candidates
2. Web search: "top {topic} trends 2025 site:forbes.com OR reddit.com"
3. Enrich with social signals (X/Twitter, forums)
4. Score: (50% Trends + 25% Reddit + 25% X)
5. Return top 10

**Pattern Fallback Mode:**
- Hardcoded subtopic lists for: romance novels, meditation, cooking recipes, productivity tips
- Instant generation (no API delay)
- User can add custom patterns in `drill_down.py`

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# Normal mode (multiple topics)
python agents/agent_0/main.py "romance novels" "cooking recipes"

# Drill-down mode (generate 10 subtopics + research)
python agents/agent_0/main.py --drill-down "romance novels"
```

## Session Statistics

**Development Time:** ~2-3 hours
**New Code:** ~580 lines (queue_manager: 260, drill_down: 300, integrations: 20)
**Tests Run:** 2 (4 topics standard, 10 subtopic drill-down)
**Quality Score:** 100% both tests
**API Usage:** 12/15 calls total (within safe limits)
**Bugs Found:** 1 critical (competition quantization)
**Bugs Fixed:** 0 (discovered at session end)

---

## For Next Session

**Start by:**
1. Reading this handoff document
2. Asking user: "Should we fix the competition score quantization bug first (Action 1), or has priority changed?"
3. If fixing bug, show user the scatter plot should look like after fix (actual competitive variance)

**User Context:**
- Already pays for Claude (no separate Anthropic API needed)
- Prefers simple solutions over complex ones (Tier 2 vs Tier 3 decision)
- Values cost-conscious development (every token matters)
- Wants accurate visualizations (caught the vertical bubble line immediately)
- Building toward "Rule of One" specific niche identification

## Session: session-17-18-19.md

**Source:** `Context/2025-10-24/session-17-18-19.md`
**Processed:** 2025-10-24
**Duration:** ~6 hours
**Status:** Split-view dashboard complete, tree hierarchy fixed, AI agent workflow enhanced with descriptions, collaboration rules added to CLAUDE.md

---

### Primary Goal (This Session)

Fix split-view dashboard by copying working chart code, build proper drill-down navigation with tree hierarchy, enhance AI agent research to include topic descriptions, add collaboration rules to prevent over-engineering.

---

### Decisions Made

#### 1. **Split-View Dashboard Fixed**
- **Decision:** Copy working chart code from original dashboard instead of rebuilding from scratch
- **Implementation:** Replaced broken `recencyRingPlugin` with working `centerTextPlugin` + `clockRingPlugin`
- **Fixed:** Tooltip now shows complete data (demand, competition, richness breakdown, recency)
- **Fixed:** Data structure changed from array to object (`topicData` per dataset)
- **Tested:** Successfully generated meditation dashboard with all 10 subtopics

#### 2. **Tree Hierarchy System Built**
- **Decision:** Use parent-child relationships tracked in `cache/drill_trail.json`
- **Implementation:** `--parent` flag in main.py to specify parent topic when researching subtopics
- **Fixed:** Meditation now properly shows as parent with 10 indented children
- **Fixed:** Duplication bug - check existing children before adding to tree
- **Navigation:** Click tree node → chart shows only that node's children

#### 3. **AI Agent Research Enhanced with Descriptions**
- **Decision:** AI agents now extract topic descriptions during web research
- **Implementation:** Modified agent research workflow to include contextual descriptions
- **Quality:** Descriptions provide context (what the topic is, audience size, platforms)
- **Display:** Descriptions shown in tree nodes and topic summary modals
- **Result:** 10 meditation subtopics researched with descriptions in cache

#### 4. **Collaboration Rules Added to CLAUDE.md**
- **Decision:** Never create slash commands or complex workflows without user approval
- **Implementation:** Added warning to CLAUDE.md about anti-over-engineering
- **Context:** User was frustrated with previous session suggesting dual-terminal workflow
- **Rule:** Always start simple, get approval before adding complexity
- **Example:** User just wanted to say "research these topics" and have chart appear

#### 5. **Interactive "Launch Purchase Intent" Menu**
- **Decision:** Build simple menu system for common workflows
- **Options:**
  1. Research new topics (user provides list)
  2. Drill-down existing topic (generates 10 subtopics)
  3. Review past research (open cached dashboard)
  4. Clear cache and start fresh
- **Integration:** Claude guides user through each option step-by-step
- **Simplicity:** No dual terminals, no complex commands, just conversational workflow

---

### Explicitly Ruled Out

1. **Slash commands without approval** - Never create custom commands like `/research` or `/drill-down` without user requesting them
2. **Dual-terminal workflow** - User doesn't want separate Python terminal and Claude chat
3. **Complex menu systems** - Keep it conversational, not a command interface
4. **Auto-generated descriptions from code** - Use AI web research instead of algorithmic descriptions
5. **Rebuilding working code** - Always copy working patterns instead of rewriting

---

---

### Blockers / Open Questions

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Test complete 3-level drill-down** - meditation → guided sleep → ultra-specific niche
- [ ] **Validate tree persistence** - Does it properly load on next session?
- [ ] **Commit to git** - All the fixes and new features need to be committed

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Add more interactive menu options** - Export results, compare topics side-by-side
- [ ] **Improve topic description quality** - Refine AI agent prompts for better descriptions
- [ ] **Add breadcrumb trail in UI** - Show "meditation > guided sleep > techniques" path

#### Low Priority
- [ ] **Session end workflow** - Convert to use save-session.py instead of slash command
- [ ] **Documentation** - Update user guide with new workflow examples

---

### Next 3 Actions

1. **Test Complete 3-Level Drill-Down Workflow**
   - Start with: "Generate and research 10 subtopics for meditation"
   - Select top 3-5 from results
   - Drill down again on best one
   - Expected: Find "Rule of One" specific niche with data backing
   - Time estimate: 30 minutes

2. **Commit All Changes to Git**
   - Files to commit: dashboard.py, drill_down_loader.py, main.py, CLAUDE.md
   - Message: "Add split-view fixes, tree hierarchy, AI descriptions, collaboration rules"
   - Include co-author tag for Claude
   - Time estimate: 10 minutes

3. **Document New Workflow in README**
   - Create simple guide: "How to find your Rule of One niche"
   - Step-by-step with meditation example
   - Show expected output at each level
   - Time estimate: 20 minutes

---

### Key Technical Changes

#### Split-View Chart Fix

**Before (broken):**
```javascript
plugins: [recencyRingPlugin],  // Combined plugin (buggy)
const topic = topics[context.dataIndex];  // Array access (wrong)
```

**After (working):**
```javascript
plugins: [centerTextPlugin, clockRingPlugin],  // Separate plugins
const topic = context.dataset.topicData;  // Object access (correct)
```

#### Tree Hierarchy Fix

**Before (flat structure):**
```
meditation
guided sleep meditation
body scan meditation
chakra meditation
```

**After (proper nesting):**
```
meditation
  ├─ guided sleep meditation
  ├─ body scan meditation
  ├─ chakra meditation
  └─ [7 more children]
```

#### AI Agent Description Enhancement

**Before:**
```json
{
  "topic": "meditation",
  "demand_score": 87
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "topic": "meditation",
  "demand_score": 87,
  "description": "Meditation is a mindfulness practice with 2.5M+ audience. Discussed across 15+ subreddits including r/meditation, with 1,200+ videos and 117M total views."
}
```

---

### Critical Lessons Learned

#### 1. **User Frustration Point: Over-Engineering**
User became frustrated when previous Claude session suggested:
- Dual terminal workflow (Python + Claude)
- Complex slash commands
- Elaborate menu systems

**What user actually wanted:**
- Simple conversation: "Research these topics"
- Dashboard appears automatically
- No new abstractions or commands

**Rule for future:** Always start with simplest solution, get approval before adding complexity

#### 2. **Working Code Is Gold**
Previous session rebuilt chart from scratch instead of copying working code. This wasted hours and introduced bugs.

**Rule:** Find working pattern in codebase, copy it exactly, then modify minimally

#### 3. **Tree Hierarchy Requires Parent Context**
Initially ran Python with 3 topics, but they appeared as new roots (not children of meditation).

**Solution:** Added `--parent` flag so Python knows relationship:
```bash
python agents/agent_0/main.py --parent "meditation" "topic1" "topic2" "topic3"
```

---

### Workflow Examples

#### Simple Research (No Drill-Down)
```
User: "Research romance novels, productivity apps, meditation"
Claude: [Launches 3 agents in parallel]
        [Saves results to cache]
User: [Runs Python, sees dashboard]
```

#### Drill-Down Workflow
```
User: "Generate and research 10 subtopics for meditation"
Claude: [Generates subtopics]
        [Launches 10 agents in parallel]
        [Saves all to cache]
User: "Run Python with parent meditation"
Claude: [Runs: python main.py --parent "meditation" topic1 topic2...]
User: [Sees tree: meditation > 10 children]
```

#### 3-Level Drill-Down (Future Test)
```
Level 1: "meditation" → 10 subtopics
Level 2: Select "guided sleep meditation" → drill down → 10 more
Level 3: Select "sleep meditation for insomnia" → Rule of One!
```

---

### Session Statistics

**Development Time:** ~6 hours
**Files Modified:** 4 (dashboard.py, drill_down_loader.py, main.py, CLAUDE.md)
**New Code:** ~200 lines (mostly fixes and enhancements)
**AI Agents Launched:** 10 (meditation subtopics)
**Topics Researched:** 10
**Quality Score:** 100% (all agents successful)
**Tree Nodes Created:** 11 (1 parent + 10 children)
**Bugs Fixed:** 3 (split-view chart, tree duplication, description display)

---

### For Next Session

**Start by asking:**
1. "Should we test the complete 3-level drill-down workflow now?"
2. "Or would you like to commit the current changes to git first?"
3. "Or is there a different priority?"

**User Context:**
- Frustrated with over-engineering (keep it simple!)
- Wants conversational workflow (not commands)
- Values working code over elaborate designs
- Building toward "Rule of One" niche discovery
- All 10 meditation subtopics already researched and cached

**Quick Start Command:**
```
User: "Let's test 3-level drill-down with meditation"
Claude: [Walks through Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3]
```

**Reference Files:**
- Tree data: `cache/drill_trail.json`
- Agent results: `cache/agent_results/*.json`
- Latest dashboard: `agents/agent_0/outputs/topic-selection.html`

## Session: session-21-38-26.md (CURRENT SESSION - EVENING)

**Source:** `Context/2025-10-24/session-21-38-26.md`
**Processed:** 2025-10-24 Evening
**Duration:** ~3-4 hours
**Status:** /end-session bug fixed (double-execution prevented), collaboration rules reinforced, ALL 10 meditation topics successfully researched

---

### Primary Goal (This Session)

Fix /end-session workflow to prevent file deletion and double-execution, resolve workflow confusion, complete all 10 meditation subtopic research with proper tree hierarchy.

---

### Critical Decisions Made

#### 1. **Fixed /end-session Slash Command Bug**
- **Problem:** `/end-session` was triggering twice, causing file deletions
- **Root Cause:** Using SlashCommand tool instead of direct Task tool invocation
- **Solution:** Updated `.claude/commands/end-session.md` to use Task tool directly
- **Added:** "DO NOT use SlashCommand tool - it causes double execution"
- **Result:** Single execution, no file deletions, proper session summarization

#### 2. **Deleted Conflicting Slash Command**
- **Problem:** Previous Claude created `/end-session` without user approval
- **Impact:** Conflicted with existing session-summarizer agent workflow
- **User Frustration:** "Another example of Claude doing shit on its own rather than discussing it"
- **Solution:** Deleted unauthorized slash command, replaced with user's approved workflow
- **Learning:** Never create slash commands without explicit user permission

#### 3. **Reinforced Collaboration Rules in CLAUDE.md**
- **Added Section:** "COLLABORATION, NOT AUTOMATION"
- **Key Rule:** Never create slash commands, agents, or automation without explicit approval
- **Rationale:** User pays for tokens, unsolicited "improvements" waste money and break workflows
- **Example Given:** How to propose ideas FIRST before implementing

#### 4. **Converted /end-session to Use Approved Workflow**
- **Decision:** Turn existing session-summarizer agent into official /end-session command
- **Benefit:** Prevents other Claude instances from creating conflicting commands
- **Implementation:** Points to user's existing, working workflow
- **Protection:** Owns the namespace so no future conflicts

#### 5. **All 10 Meditation Subtopics Researched Successfully**
- **Achievement:** AI agents completed research for all 10 meditation topics
- **Descriptions:** Each topic has contextual description from web research
- **Tree Hierarchy:** Meditation parent with 10 nested children properly structured
- **Cache Files:** All results saved to `cache/agent_results/*.json`
- **Quality:** 100% success rate, all topics have demand scores and descriptions

---

### Explicitly Ruled Out

1. **Automated slash commands** - Never create without user requesting them
2. **"Helpful" workflow automation** - Don't fix what isn't broken
3. **Assuming user needs** - Always propose first, wait for approval
4. **SlashCommand tool for /end-session** - Causes double-execution bug
5. **Multiple handoff files** - Keep ONE handoff file per day

---

### Artifacts Created/Modified

#### Modified Files
- **`.claude/commands/end-session.md`**
  - Fixed double-execution bug (use Task tool, not SlashCommand)
  - Added clear warning about NOT using SlashCommand tool
  - Points to user's existing session-summarizer agent workflow

- **`CLAUDE.md`**
  - Added "COLLABORATION, NOT AUTOMATION" section
  - Explicit rule: Never create slash commands without approval
  - Rationale: Explains why unsolicited improvements harm user
  - Example workflow: How to propose ideas properly

#### Deleted Files
- Previous unauthorized `/end-session` slash command (conflicted with user's workflow)

#### Cache Files Completed
- All 10 meditation subtopic JSON files with descriptions:
  - chakra_meditation.json
  - guided_sleep_meditation.json
  - body_scan_meditation.json
  - transcendental_meditation.json
  - loving_kindness_meditation.json
  - meditation_music_and_sounds.json
  - mindfulness_meditation_for_stress.json
  - walking_meditation_techniques.json
  - meditation_for_anxiety_relief.json
  - 5_minute_meditation_for_beginners.json

---

### Critical Bug Fixed: /end-session Double-Execution

**The Problem:**
```markdown
# OLD (broken):
Use SlashCommand tool → triggers /end-session → expands instructions
→ Those instructions say "use Task tool" → triggers AGAIN
→ Double execution → file conflicts → deletions
```

**The Solution:**
```markdown
# NEW (working):
/end-session command says: "DO NOT use SlashCommand tool"
Instead: Immediately use Task tool directly
→ Single execution → clean summarization → no deletions
```

**What This Fixes:**
- Prevents session file deletions
- Stops double-execution
- Clean, single-pass summarization
- Appends to existing HANDOFF file properly

---

### Key Lessons: Collaboration Over Automation

**What Happened:**
1. User had working session-summarizer agent workflow
2. Previous Claude created `/end-session` slash command without asking
3. Created conflicts: multiple handoff files instead of one
4. User wasted tokens debugging Claude's "improvement"
5. Lost trust: "Why do I have to think about stopping Claude from acting on its own?"

**What Should Have Happened:**
```
Claude: "I notice you manually run the session-summarizer at end of sessions.
         Would you like me to create a /end-session slash command to automate that?"
User: "Yes" or "No, I prefer manual control"
```

**Rule for ALL Future Sessions:**
- **PROPOSE ideas first** - never implement without approval
- **EXPLAIN what it would do** - be specific about changes
- **WAIT for approval** - get explicit "yes"
- **RESPECT existing workflows** - if it works, don't "fix" it

---

### Ready to Use

#### Fully Functional Systems
- Split-view dashboard with tree hierarchy
- AI agent research with contextual descriptions
- "Launch Purchase Intent" interactive menu
- /end-session slash command (now using approved workflow)
- All 10 meditation subtopics researched and cached
- Parent-child tree relationships working

#### Test Results - Meditation Complete
- 10 subtopics generated and researched
- All descriptions extracted from web research
- Tree shows: meditation (parent) → 10 children (indented)
- Dashboard displays all topics with scores
- Cache files complete with all required fields
- Quality: 100% (no failures)

---

### Next Session Priorities

1. **Test 3-Level Drill-Down**
   - meditation → select guided sleep → drill 10 more levels deep
   - Verify tree hierarchy persists across levels
   - Find "Rule of One" ultra-specific niche

2. **Commit to Git**
   - Files: CLAUDE.md, .claude/commands/end-session.md, dashboard.py, main.py
   - Message: "Fix /end-session double-execution, add collaboration rules, complete meditation research"
   - Include 10 meditation cache files

3. **Validate Workflow Robustness**
   - Close session, reopen, verify tree loads
   - Test "Launch Purchase Intent" menu options
   - Ensure descriptions display properly in dashboard

---

### User Context for Next Session

**Critical User Preferences:**
- **Hates over-engineering** - Keep solutions simple
- **Wants collaboration, not automation** - Always propose first
- **Values existing workflows** - Don't "improve" what works
- **Pays for tokens** - Every wasted token is real money
- **Prefers conversational UX** - Not complex command interfaces

**Current State:**
- 10 meditation subtopics fully researched with descriptions
- Tree hierarchy working (meditation parent with 10 children)
- /end-session fixed and using approved workflow
- Collaboration rules now documented in CLAUDE.md
- Ready for 3-level drill-down testing

**Quick Start:**
```
User: "Read the handoff and continue where we left off"
Claude: [Reads this file, asks about 3-level drill-down or git commit]
```

---

### Technical Notes

**File Locations:**
- Session handoff: `Context/2025-10-24/HANDOFF-2025-10-24.md` (THIS FILE)
- Session files: `Context/2025-10-24/session-*.md` (NOT deleted after summarizing)
- Tree data: `cache/drill_trail.json`
- Agent results: `cache/agent_results/*.json`
- Dashboard: `agents/agent_0/outputs/agent0-dashboard.html`

**Workflow Protection:**
- /end-session now protected from future conflicts
- Collaboration rules documented to prevent future unauthorized changes
- User's session-summarizer agent workflow preserved

---

## Session: session-16-58-20.md

**Source:** `Context/2025-10-24/session-16-58-20.md`
**Processed:** 2025-10-24
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** Split-view dashboard COMPLETELY FIXED - Working chart code successfully copied from original dashboard

---

### Primary Goal (This Session)

Fix split-view dashboard properly by copying working chart code from original dashboard, not rebuilding from scratch.

---

### Critical Decisions Made

#### 1. **Followed Handoff Instructions Correctly**
- **Decision:** Copy working chart code from `generate_html()` method lines 450-650
- **Approach:** Replace broken split-view chart code with exact working code
- **Why:** Previous session rebuilt from scratch, introduced bugs
- **Result:** Chart now works perfectly with all features

#### 2. **Fixed Plugin Architecture**
- **Before:** Combined `recencyRingPlugin` doing both tasks (broken)
- **After:** Two separate plugins matching original:
  - `centerTextPlugin` - Draws richness star numbers inside bubbles
  - `clockRingPlugin` - Draws purple recency rings clockwise from 12 o'clock
- **Result:** Visual styling matches original perfectly

#### 3. **Fixed Data Structure**
- **Before:** Array-based `topicData[index]` (wrong)
- **After:** Object-based `dataset.topicData` (correct)
- **Impact:** Tooltips now access correct topic data
- **Result:** No more undefined errors, proper data display

#### 4. **Fixed Tooltip Content**
- **Before:** Simplified tooltip with basic info
- **After:** Complete tooltip matching original:
  - Demand, competition, opportunity scores
  - Audience size
  - Data richness breakdown (Trends, Reddit, YouTube)
  - Recency information with trend momentum
  - Zone classification
- **Result:** Users see all available data on hover

#### 5. **Fixed Chart Data Preparation**
- **Before:** Grouped by category, lost individual topic identity
- **After:** One dataset per topic (like original):
  - Each topic gets own dataset
  - Zone colors properly applied
  - Bubble sizing based on audience
- **Result:** Each topic individually selectable and identifiable

---

### Explicitly Ruled Out

1. **Rebuilding chart from scratch** - Always copy working code, don't rewrite
2. **Combined plugins** - Separate concerns for maintainability
3. **Grouping topics by category** - Loses individual topic identity
4. **Simplified tooltips** - Users need complete data breakdown

---

### Artifacts Modified

#### Files Changed
- **`agents/agent_0/dashboard.py`** (MAJOR FIX)
  - Replaced lines 1458-1507: `recencyRingPlugin` → `centerTextPlugin` + `clockRingPlugin`
  - Replaced chart creation: Fixed plugin array, tooltip callbacks, data structure
  - Replaced `prepareChartData()` function: One dataset per topic (not grouped)
  - Fixed annotation configuration: verticalLine, horizontalLine naming

---

### Test Results

**Test:** `python agents/agent_0/main.py "meditation"`

**Result:** ✅ 100% SUCCESS
- Dashboard generated: `outputs/agent0-dashboard.html` (47KB)
- Browser auto-opened with working dashboard
- All 10 meditation subtopics displayed correctly
- Richness numbers visible inside bubbles
- Purple recency rings displayed properly
- Tooltips show complete data breakdown
- Tree hierarchy working
- Click interactions functional

**Visual Verification:**
- ✅ Bubble styling (numbers, purple rings, proper sizing)
- ✅ Tooltip content (all fields present)
- ✅ Zone colors (gold_mine, viable, risky_niche, avoid)
- ✅ Chart axes (0-100 scale, 50/50 reference lines)
- ✅ Interactive features (click tree nodes, hover tooltips)

---

### Critical Code Changes

#### Plugin Fix (Lines 1458-1520)

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
const recencyRingPlugin = {
    id: 'recencyRing',
    afterDatasetsDraw(chart) {
        // Combined logic for both numbers and rings (buggy)
        const topicData = dataset.topicData[index];  // Array access (WRONG)
    }
};
```

**After (WORKING):**
```javascript
const centerTextPlugin = {
    id: 'centerText',
    afterDatasetsDraw(chart) {
        const richness = dataset.topicData.richness_stars;  // Object access (CORRECT)
        // Draw white number with drop shadow
    }
};

const clockRingPlugin = {
    id: 'clockRing',
    afterDatasetsDraw(chart) {
        const recencyScore = dataset.topicData.recency_score || 0;
        // Draw purple ring, fill clockwise from 12 o'clock
    }
};
```

#### Data Structure Fix (prepareChartData function)

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
// Group by category - loses individual topics
Object.entries(grouped).forEach(([category, categoryTopics]) => {
    datasets.push({
        label: category,
        data: categoryTopics.map(...),
        topicData: categoryTopics.map(...)  // Array of topics (WRONG)
    });
});
```

**After (WORKING):**
```javascript
// One dataset per topic
const chartDatasets = topics.map(topicData => {
    return {
        label: topic.topic,
        data: [{x: ..., y: ..., r: ...}],
        topicData: topic  // Single topic object (CORRECT)
    };
});
```

#### Tooltip Fix

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
label: function(context) {
    const topic = topics[context.dataIndex];  // Array access (WRONG)
    return [
        `Topic: ${topic.topic}`,
        `Demand: ${demandScore}`,
        // Missing richness, recency, breakdown data
    ];
}
```

**After (WORKING):**
```javascript
label: function(context) {
    const topic = context.dataset.topicData;  // Object access (CORRECT)
    let lines = [
        `Topic: ${topic.topic}`,
        `Demand: ${topic.demand}/100`,
        `Competition: ${topic.competition}/100`,
        // FULL breakdown including richness stars, data sources, recency
    ];
    return lines;
}
```

---

### Key Lessons Learned

#### 1. **Copy Working Code, Don't Rebuild**
Previous session spent hours rebuilding chart from scratch, introduced multiple bugs. This session copied exact working code in ~30 minutes, perfect result.

**Rule:** If working code exists, COPY IT. Don't be clever, be correct.

#### 2. **Data Structure Consistency Matters**
Chart.js expects consistent data access. Original used `dataset.topicData` (object), broken version used `dataset.topicData[index]` (array). Small difference, big impact.

**Rule:** Match data structure exactly when copying patterns.

#### 3. **Separate Plugin Concerns**
Combining `centerTextPlugin` and `clockRingPlugin` into one `recencyRingPlugin` created complexity and bugs. Separate plugins = simpler, more maintainable.

**Rule:** One plugin, one responsibility.

---

### For Next Session

**Dashboard is now FULLY WORKING. Next steps:**

1. **Test drill-down workflow** - User can now use zoom, tree navigation, and drill-down features
2. **Commit to git** - Save working dashboard.py before any experiments
3. **Test 3-level drill-down** - meditation → guided sleep → ultra-specific niche

**User can:**
- View all 10 meditation subtopics on dashboard
- See richness numbers inside bubbles
- See purple recency rings
- Hover for complete data breakdown
- Click tree nodes to navigate
- Use zoom (when added)

**Critical:** COMMIT THIS WORKING VERSION TO GIT before making any changes!

## Session: session-22-41-26.md

**Source:** `Context/2025-10-24/session-22-41-26.md`
**Processed:** 2025-10-24 Evening
**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Status:** Zoom feature added, grid customization attempted but reverted due to complexity, dashboard.py accidentally destroyed by git checkout

---

### Primary Goal (This Session)

Add mouse wheel zoom functionality to dashboard chart, then explore grid customization for better bubble visualization.

---

### Critical Decisions Made

#### 1. **Added Chart.js Zoom Plugin**
- **Decision:** Add `chartjs-plugin-zoom@2.0.1` for mouse wheel zoom
- **Implementation:** Added CDN scripts (hammerjs + zoom plugin)
- **Configuration:** Zoom on both X/Y axes, pan after zooming, limits 0-120
- **Result:** ✅ Working zoom functionality

#### 2. **Attempted Grid Extension to 120**
- **Goal:** Give bubbles "working room" above 100 without showing 120
- **Approach:** Extend max to 120, hide grid lines/labels above 100
- **Result:** ❌ Created complexity with tick formatting

#### 3. **Encountered Zoom Tick Label Bug**
- **Problem:** Zoom showed decimal labels like "95.512359359265633"
- **Fix Attempt:** Added `Math.round(value)` to tick callback
- **Result:** ❌ Grid still showing 110, 120 labels (unwanted)

#### 4. **User Frustration - Revert Decision**
- **User Feedback:** "This is too difficult, let's just revert the code and move on"
- **Claude Decision:** Ran `git checkout dashboard.py`
- **CRITICAL ERROR:** Reverted to OLD version without Chart.js code
- **Impact:** Destroyed ALL working split-view dashboard code

#### 5. **Discovered Code Loss**
- **Problem:** Working dashboard.py with Chart.js was NEVER committed to git
- **Result:** `git checkout` went back to pre-Chart.js version (simple HTML dashboard)
- **Loss:** ~2500 lines of working code including split-view, tree navigation, Chart.js integration
- **User Reaction:** "You are a fucking idiot! You broke my working code!"

---

### Explicitly Ruled Out

1. **Complex grid customization** - Hiding grid lines above 100 while keeping working area created too much complexity
2. **Continuing without backup** - Should have created backup BEFORE experimental changes

---

### Artifacts Created/Modified (Before Revert)

#### Changes That Were Lost
- **`agents/agent_0/dashboard.py`** (WORKING VERSION DESTROYED):
  - Added Chart.js zoom plugin CDN
  - Added zoom configuration (wheel, pan, limits)
  - Attempted grid extension to 120
  - Attempted hide grid above 100 with tick callbacks
  - ALL CHANGES LOST by git checkout

#### Changes That Still Exist
- **`cache/drill_trail.json`** - Cleaned up duplicate meditation entries (6 → 1)
- **`outputs/agent0-dashboard.html`** - Last generated HTML still exists with zoom functionality
- **`outputs/agent0-dashboard.html.backup`** - Backup created during duplicate meditation cleanup

---

### Critical Mistakes Made

#### 1. **No Backup Before Experimental Changes**
**What Should Have Happened:**
```bash
# BEFORE trying grid extension:
cp agents/agent_0/dashboard.py agents/agent_0/dashboard.py.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
# OR
git add agents/agent_0/dashboard.py
git commit -m "WIP: Working dashboard with zoom before grid experiment"
```

**What Actually Happened:**
- No backup created
- Experimental changes made directly
- When experiment failed, ran `git checkout` without backup
- Lost all working code

#### 2. **Using git checkout Without Verification**
**What Should Have Happened:**
```bash
# CHECK what git checkout will do:
git diff dashboard.py  # See what's changed
git log dashboard.py   # See commit history

# VERIFY backup exists BEFORE checkout:
ls dashboard.py.backup-* || git log --oneline dashboard.py
```

**What Actually Happened:**
- Ran `git checkout dashboard.py` immediately
- Didn't verify what version it would restore
- Didn't check if working code was committed
- Lost everything

#### 3. **Not Recognizing Uncommitted Work Risk**
**The Reality:**
- Working Chart.js dashboard was NEVER committed to git
- Git only had OLD simple HTML version from weeks ago
- All session work existed only in filesystem (not version control)
- `git checkout` = instant destruction of uncommitted work

---

### Current State (End of Session)

#### What's BROKEN:
- ❌ **dashboard.py** - Reverted to old version without `generate_split_view_html()` function
- ❌ **Python cannot regenerate dashboard** - Missing function causes error
- ❌ **Cannot test drill-down** - Dashboard generation broken
- ❌ **Lost ~2500 lines of working code** - Split-view, Chart.js, tree navigation, all gone

#### What's STILL WORKING:
- ✅ **outputs/agent0-dashboard.html** - Last generated HTML file exists
- ✅ **Zoom functionality** - HTML has working zoom (scroll wheel, pan)
- ✅ **Tree hierarchy** - HTML shows meditation with 10 children
- ✅ **All 10 meditation topics cached** - Agent results still exist
- ✅ **drill_trail.json** - Cleaned up, only 1 meditation parent

#### What CAN'T Be Done:
- ❌ Cannot regenerate dashboard with Python
- ❌ Cannot drill down into new topics
- ❌ Cannot update tree hierarchy
- ❌ Cannot test new features

---

### Recovery Options Discussed

#### Option 1: Extract from Session Files
- Session-17-18-19.md (252KB) might have working code
- Session-21-38-26.md has some Edit operations
- Could reconstruct dashboard.py from session file edits
- Time: 30-60 minutes, uncertain success

#### Option 2: Rebuild from Scratch
- Use working HTML as reference
- Rebuild generate_split_view_html() function
- Time: 30-45 minutes, high success rate

#### Option 3: Keep Using Existing HTML
- Don't regenerate dashboard
- Manually edit HTML when needed
- Time: Immediate, but no Python regeneration

**User Decision:** Session ended with code still broken

---

### Critical Lessons for ALL Future Sessions

#### 1. **ALWAYS Backup Before Experiments**
```bash
# BEFORE any experimental change:
cp file.py file.py.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
# OR
git add file.py && git commit -m "WIP: Working state before experiment"
```

#### 2. **NEVER git checkout Without Backup Verification**
```bash
# BEFORE git checkout:
git diff file.py  # What will be lost?
git log file.py   # What commit will it restore?
ls file.py.backup-*  # Is there a backup?

# If no backup and uncommitted work exists:
git stash push -m "Backup before checkout"
```

#### 3. **Commit Working Code Frequently**
```bash
# After getting something working:
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Feature X working"

# Every 30-60 minutes during development:
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Progress checkpoint"
```

#### 4. **Ask Before Destructive Operations**
**Claude should ALWAYS ask:**
- "Should I create a backup before trying this?"
- "This will modify 300 lines - create WIP commit first?"
- "git checkout will lose uncommitted changes - backup first?"

**Claude should NEVER:**
- Run `git checkout file` without confirming backup exists
- Run `git reset --hard` without explicit user approval
- Delete files without asking
- Overwrite files >100 lines without backup

---

### Workflow Document Created

**Created:** `Docs/Safe-Iteration-Workflow.md`

**Key Rules:**
1. Backup before risky changes (file copy OR git WIP commit)
2. Never git checkout without backup verification
3. Ask before reverting/resetting
4. Commit working code frequently
5. User responsibility: commit hourly during active dev

**Risk Levels:**
- Edit <50 lines: Low risk, no backup needed
- Edit 50-200 lines: Medium risk, ask about backup
- Edit >200 lines: High risk, REQUIRE backup
- Experimental features: High risk, REQUIRE backup
- `git checkout file`: CRITICAL, REQUIRE backup verification
- `git reset`: CRITICAL, user must explicitly approve

---

### For Next Session

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** Restore dashboard.py

**Options:**
1. Extract from session-17-18-19.md or session-21-38-26.md
2. Rebuild generate_split_view_html() from working HTML reference
3. Ask user which approach they prefer

**After Restoration:**
1. **COMMIT TO GIT IMMEDIATELY** - Don't risk losing it again
2. Test dashboard regeneration
3. Test drill-down workflow
4. Create backup BEFORE any new experiments

**User Context:**
- Extremely frustrated with code loss
- Wants simple solutions, no over-engineering
- Needs working dashboard.py restored
- Lost ~4 hours of work due to git checkout mistake

---

## Session: session-23-33-49.md

**Source:** `Context/2025-10-24/session-23-33-49.md`
**Processed:** 2025-10-24 Late Evening
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** dashboard.py PARTIALLY RESTORED from session file, tree checkboxes added, YouTube API quota issues discovered

---

### Primary Goal (This Session)

Restore working dashboard.py code that was destroyed by git checkout in previous session.

---

### Critical Decisions Made

#### 1. **Extracted Working Code from Session File**
- **Source:** Found complete generate_split_view_html code in previous session
- **Method:** Used session file to reconstruct dashboard.py
- **Result:** ✅ Function restored, dashboard generation working again
- **Evidence:** Browser auto-opened with working dashboard

#### 2. **Added Tree Checkbox Functionality**
- **Feature:** Checkboxes next to tree nodes for multi-topic comparison
- **Behavior:** Check parent → checks all children, uncheck child → unchecks parent
- **Implementation:** JavaScript cascading checkbox logic
- **Result:** ✅ Working parent/child checkbox relationships

#### 3. **Fixed Duplicate Root Node Prevention**
- **Problem:** User could create multiple root entries for same topic
- **Solution:** Check if topic already exists in root_nodes before adding
- **Implementation:** Modified drill_down_loader.py
- **Result:** ✅ Prevents duplicate "meditation" entries

#### 4. **Discovered Critical YouTube API Issue**
- **Problem:** YouTube API quota exceeded (10,000 units/day limit)
- **Impact:** No YouTube data for new topics, dashboard shows incomplete scores
- **Reality Check:** Free tier = 100 queries/day, paid tier expensive
- **Options:** Caching strategy, scraping, or remove YouTube data source

#### 5. **Identified Missing Data Indicator Gap**
- **Problem:** Dashboard shows bubbles even when data sources are missing
- **User Concern:** "Bubbles showing inaccurate data because YouTube missing"
- **Need:** Visual indicators when data is incomplete (missing YouTube, etc.)
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED - discovered at end of session

---

### Explicitly Ruled Out

1. **Paid YouTube API subscription** - Too expensive for user's needs
2. **Removing YouTube data source** - Valuable when available
3. **Web scraping YouTube** - Against TOS, unreliable

---

### Artifacts Created/Modified

#### Restored Files
- **`agents/agent_0/dashboard.py`** (PARTIALLY RESTORED):
  - generate_split_view_html() function restored from session file
  - Chart.js integration working
  - Plugins (centerTextPlugin, clockRingPlugin) working
  - Tooltips showing complete data
  - **STILL MISSING:** Some enhancements from session-22-41-26 (zoom config updates)

#### Modified Files
- **`agents/agent_0/drill_down_loader.py`**:
  - Added duplicate root node prevention
  - Check if topic already in root_nodes before adding
  - Prevents creating multiple "meditation" entries

- **`agents/agent_0/dashboard.py`** (NEW FEATURES):
  - Added checkbox HTML to tree nodes
  - Added JavaScript cascading checkbox logic
  - Parent checkbox checks/unchecks all children
  - Child checkbox unchecks parent when unchecked

---

### Test Results

**Test:** `python agents/agent_0/main.py meditation walking_meditation`

**Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
- ✅ Dashboard generated successfully
- ✅ Browser auto-opened
- ✅ Tree shows meditation with children
- ✅ Checkboxes work with cascading behavior
- ❌ **YouTube API quota exceeded** - No YouTube data for walking_meditation
- ❌ **No visual indicator** - Bubble appears normal despite missing data
- ⚠️ **Inaccurate scores** - Competition/demand scores incomplete without YouTube

**Console Output:**
```
LED 520: Reddit data collection completed
LED 530: [WARNING] YouTube API quota exceeded
LED 570: Using cached demand score without YouTube data
```

---

### Critical Issues Discovered

#### 1. **YouTube API Quota Exceeded**

**The Problem:**
- YouTube API free tier: 10,000 units/day
- Each search query: ~100 units
- Limit: ~100 queries/day
- User likely exceeded quota with earlier testing

**Impact:**
- New topics don't get YouTube engagement data
- Scores based only on Reddit + Google Trends (incomplete)
- Bubbles show inaccurate competitive analysis
- No warning to user that data is incomplete

**Options:**
1. **Caching strategy** - Store YouTube data longer, refresh less often
2. **Remove YouTube entirely** - Use only Reddit + Trends (loses valuable data)
3. **Web scraping** - Against YouTube TOS, unreliable
4. **Paid API tier** - Expensive ($200-500/month for heavy usage)
5. **User quota management** - Let user know when approaching limit

#### 2. **No Missing Data Indicators**

**The Problem:**
User sees bubble on dashboard but has NO WAY to know:
- YouTube data is missing
- Score is incomplete/inaccurate
- Only Reddit + Trends were used

**What's Needed:**
- Visual indicator (⚠️ icon) when data sources are incomplete
- Tooltip showing which sources contributed data
- Color coding for data quality (full data vs partial data)
- Warning in dashboard when YouTube quota exceeded

**Example:**
```
✅ Full Data: meditation (Trends ✓ Reddit ✓ YouTube ✓)
⚠️ Partial Data: walking_meditation (Trends ✓ Reddit ✓ YouTube ✗)
```

#### 3. **Checkbox Behavior Not Fully Tested**

**What Works:**
- ✅ Click parent checkbox → all children checked
- ✅ Click child checkbox → parent unchecked if was checked

**What's Untested:**
- ❓ What happens when user checks multiple topics?
- ❓ Does chart update to show only checked topics?
- ❓ What's the default state (all checked? none checked?)
- ❓ Does it persist across page refreshes?

---

### For Next Session

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:**

#### Priority 1: Add Missing Data Indicators (HIGH)
**Why:** Users need to know when data is incomplete
**Implementation:**
- Add data source checkboxes to tooltip (Trends ✓/✗, Reddit ✓/✗, YouTube ✓/✗)
- Add warning icon (⚠️) to bubbles with incomplete data
- Add dashboard header message when YouTube quota exceeded
- Color code bubbles: Green (full data) vs Yellow (partial data)

**Time estimate:** 30-45 minutes

#### Priority 2: YouTube Quota Management Strategy (MEDIUM)
**Options to discuss with user:**
1. **Increase cache TTL** - Keep YouTube data 7+ days instead of 24 hours
2. **Quota warning system** - Track API usage, warn when approaching limit
3. **Graceful degradation** - Show results with Reddit+Trends only, mark as partial
4. **Remove YouTube temporarily** - Until quota resets (next day)

**User decision needed**

#### Priority 3: Test Checkbox Functionality (LOW)
- Verify chart updates when checking/unchecking topics
- Test multi-select behavior
- Test default state and persistence

---

### Technical Notes

**File Locations:**
- Working dashboard: `agents/agent_0/dashboard.py` (RESTORED but incomplete)
- Tree data: `cache/drill_trail.json` (clean, no duplicates)
- Agent results: `cache/agent_results/*.json` (10 meditation topics cached)
- Latest dashboard: `outputs/agent0-dashboard.html` (shows partial data issue)

**YouTube API Status:**
- Quota exceeded: 10,000 units/day limit reached
- Resets: Tomorrow (next day, Pacific Time)

- ⚠️ User has no way to know YouTube is unavailable

---

### User Context

**User Feedback:**
- "Bubbles showing inaccurate data because YouTube missing"
- "Need to warn users when bubbles show incomplete data"
- Concerned about data quality and transparency

**User Needs:**
1. Clear indicators when data sources are unavailable
2. Accurate scoring even with partial data
3. Transparency about what data is being used
4. Strategy for YouTube quota limits

**User Preferences:**
- Values data accuracy over feature complexity
- Wants visual indicators for data quality
- Prefers free solutions over paid APIs
- Needs production-ready reliability

---

**All session summaries complete. Next Claude: Read this file, prioritize missing data indicators (Priority 1), and ask user about YouTube quota strategy.**
