## Primary Goal

Build a purchase intent detection system for ebook/product ideas using Reddit discussions and Google Trends data (YouTube API removed due to quota denial).

---

## Decisions Made This Session

1. **YouTube API Removed Entirely** - Google denied quota increase request; decided to go Reddit + Google Trends only instead of fighting API limitations
2. **Strategic Pivot: Reddit is Better for Purchase Intent** - Recognized that Reddit discussions ("Where can I buy...", "Is it worth it?") provide more direct purchase signals than YouTube subscriber counts
3. **Added Purchase Intent Analysis Module** - Built new analyzer to detect buying signals in Reddit data (LED range 525-529)
4. **Integrated Purchase Intent into Dashboard** - Orange "Purchase Intent Analysis" section in topic popup showing scores, price ranges, and signals
5. **Scoring Algorithm Updated** - Changed from 3-source (Trends/Reddit/YouTube) to 2-source (50/50 split Trends/Reddit)
6. **Confidence Calculation Adjusted** - 2 sources = 100%, 1 source = 60% (was 3 sources = 100%, 2 = 70%, 1 = 40%)

---

## Explicitly Ruled Out

1. **YouTube API with Rate Limiting** - Grok suggested adding delays/batching to stay under quota, but rejected because quota was DENIED, not just limited
2. **BookTok (TikTok) as Alternative** - No public API, more restrictive than YouTube, worse for purchase intent than Reddit
3. **Scraping YouTube** - Fragile, may break, not worth the effort
4. **Paid YouTube API Access** - Adds cost when Reddit provides better signals for free
5. **Fighting Google for Quota Increase** - New form/process makes it harder; not worth stress when Reddit is superior data source

---

## Artifacts Created

**Code Changes:**
- `agents/agent_0/config.py` - Removed LED_YOUTUBE_START (530 range now unused)
- `agents/agent_0/api_clients.py` - Removed YouTubeClient class entirely
- `agents/agent_0/scoring.py` - Removed all YouTube scoring methods, updated composite score to 2-source model
- `agents/agent_0/competition_analyzer.py` - Updated to work with Trends + Reddit only
- `agents/agent_0/purchase_intent.py` - NEW: Analyzes Reddit for buying signals, price mentions, "worth it" questions
- `agents/agent_0/main.py` - Integrated purchase intent analysis into workflow, fixed Unicode issues for Windows console

**Dashboard Updates:**
- `outputs/agent0-dashboard.html` - Added orange Purchase Intent Analysis section to topic popup
- Visual design: Large score numbers (24px), price range cards, purchase signals with left border highlighting

**Documentation:**
- `Docs/youtube-api-removal-decision.md` - (Likely created based on grep results showing documentation references)

---

## Ready to Build

1. **Purchase Intent System Fully Operational:**
   - LED breadcrumbs 525-529 working (Analyzing purchase intent, keyword detection, price extraction, signal generation, scoring)
   - Detects keywords: "buy", "worth", "recommend", "pay", "price", "subscription"
   - Extracts price ranges ($15-$7000 detected in test)
   - Generates actionable signals ("94 posts mention buying", "28 posts ask if worth it")

2. **Data Pipeline Simplified:**
   - Google Trends (pytrends) - Search volume, interest over time, no API key needed
   - Reddit (PRAW) - Community engagement, purchase discussions, unlimited free access
   - No API quota concerns, no rate limiting stress

3. **Dashboard Visualization:**
   - Purchase Intent Score (0-100)
   - Willingness to Pay Score (0-100)
   - Price Range Mentioned (min-max-avg)
   - Top 5 Purchase Signals (actionable insights)

4. **Test Data Verified:**
   - "budget meal planning apps" - 86/100 intent, 100/100 willingness, $15-$7000 range
   - "productivity journal apps" - 46.2/100 intent, 76/100 willingness, recommendation signals detected

## Blockers / Open Questions

- [ ] None currently - system is functional and tested

---

## Next 3 Actions

1. **Test Full Drill-Down Workflow with Reddit-Only Data** - Run 3-level drill-down (meditation → walking meditation → ultra-specific niche) to verify Google Trends + Reddit pipeline works without YouTube
   - Verify dashboard shows purchase intent data at all levels
   - Check LED breadcrumbs 525-529 fire correctly throughout drill-down
   - Confirm no YouTube error messages or missing data issues

2. **Enhance Reddit Purchase Intent Detection** - Add more sophisticated signals now that YouTube is removed:
   - Sentiment analysis (positive vs negative mentions)
   - Competitor product mentions (direct brand comparisons)
   - Problem frequency clustering (repeated pain points)
   - Monetization indicators (affiliate links, sponsored mentions)

3. **Document Final Architecture** - Update project docs to reflect Reddit + Trends only:
   - Update `Docs/drill-down-prd.md` to remove YouTube references
   - Update `PROJECT_INDEX.md` with new 2-source architecture
   - Create migration note explaining why YouTube was removed (quota denial, Reddit superiority for purchase intent)

---

## Session Summary

**What Changed:** System pivoted from 3-source (Trends/Reddit/YouTube) to 2-source (Trends/Reddit) architecture after Google denied YouTube API quota increase. Instead of fighting API limitations, we recognized Reddit provides superior purchase intent signals and removed YouTube entirely.

**What Was Built:** Complete purchase intent detection system (LED 525-529) that analyzes Reddit discussions for buying signals, price mentions, and willingness-to-pay indicators. Integrated into dashboard with orange visual theme.

**What Was Tested:** Verified with "budget meal planning apps" (86/100 intent, 100/100 willingness, $15-$7000 price range) and "productivity journal apps" (46.2/100 intent, 76/100 willingness). All LED breadcrumbs working, Unicode issues fixed for Windows console.

**System Status:** Fully functional with simplified architecture. No API quota concerns. Dashboard shows purchase intent data when clicking paper icon on topics. All changes committed to git (4 commits).

---

**For next session:** Start by running full 3-level drill-down workflow to verify Reddit + Trends pipeline works without YouTube. Then consider enhancing purchase intent detection with sentiment analysis and competitor mentions.
