Trends come and go and come again. Journaling is rampantly discussed for 3 months because some influencer discovered it, then it goes quiet for a year, then pops up again. But politics, wars, and the constant turmoil discussed in social media is not of interest. So how can I find the top trends which I should consider drilling down into? A sudden interest in how to be a new dad could be good, but how do I find topics that align with me writing an ebook, compared to gossip and nonsense?Thought for 30sFinding Top Cyclic Trends for Ebook Topics in 2025
Trends in self-improvement and lifestyle topics often cycle based on cultural shifts, seasonal influences, or influencer-driven revivals—like journaling spiking during New Year's resolutions or back-to-school seasons, then fading until the next wellness wave. Based on recent data from 2025 reports and social discussions, I've identified key trends that align with ebook writing: they're actionable, have sudden surges (e.g., tied to life stages or emerging needs), and offer depth for evergreen content without veering into transient gossip or negative news. These are drawn from wellness and personal development niches, which show strong, recurring interest (e.g., mental health tools ramp up post-holidays or during economic stress).
I focused on trends with "sudden interest" potential, like your "new dad" example—topics that pop due to life events (e.g., parenthood, career changes) or broader societal shifts (e.g., remote work burnout). Excluded anything political, war-related, or sensational. Here's how to spot and drill down:
Step-by-Step Approach to Discovering These Trends

Monitor Cyclic Patterns: Use web searches for "emerging [niche] trends 2025" (e.g., wellness, parenting) to find articles on rising topics. Cross-reference with social signals (e.g., X posts with high engagement) for sudden spikes—look for min_faves:100+ and recent dates.
Filter for Ebook Fit: Prioritize trends with practical, teachable elements (e.g., skills, habits) over fleeting fads. Check for alignment with your expertise—e.g., if you're into hypnotherapy/zen, lean toward mindfulness or resilience.
Drill Down: For a trend like "new dad skills," search sub-queries like "rising parenting trends 2025 fathers" to uncover niches (e.g., "paternity leave wellness").
Validate Demand: Use free tools like Google Books Ngram or forum searches for cycle history; aim for topics with 20-50% YoY growth in mentions.
