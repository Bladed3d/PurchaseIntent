Your PRD already includes 2-3 second delays between sources, but this may not be enough if each inquiry involves multiple internal pytrends calls (e.g., for trends, related queries, or regions). The good news is there are proven workarounds to handle this without switching libraries or incurring costs—focusing on free, ethical adjustments. I'll prioritize simple, immediate fixes first, then more robust ones. These are based on pytrends documentation, GitHub issues, and community solutions.
1. Immediate Fix: Increase Delays Between Requests
The most straightforward way to avoid limits is to space out requests more aggressively. Google seems to require at least 10-60 seconds between calls to "cool off" if you're nearing a threshold.

How to Implement:

In your agents/agent_0.py (or wherever pytrends is called), wrap each pytrends method with a longer sleep. Start with 10 seconds and increase if needed.
Example code snippet (add this around your pytrends calls):
pythonimport time
from pytrends.request import TrendReq

# Initialize pytrends
pytrends = TrendReq(hl='en-US', tz=360)

# Example: Before each major call
time.sleep(10)  # Or 30-60 for safety during testing
interest_over_time = pytrends.interest_over_time(kw_list=['your_keyword'], timeframe='today 5-y')

For batch queries (e.g., multiple keywords or regions), use a loop with sleeps:
pythonkeywords = ['keyword1', 'keyword2']
for kw in keywords:
    time.sleep(10)
    # Your pytrends call here

Why This Works: Pytrends GitHub recommends 60-second sleeps after hitting limits. Users report resuming successfully after this.
Testing Tip: During app testing, manually space out your  /discover-topics runs (e.g., wait 1-2 minutes between each). This simulates lower traffic.


Pros/Cons: Free and easy; no code overhaul needed. But it slows down runtime (e.g., adding 10-30 seconds per inquiry).

2. Add Retries and Exponential Backoff
Automatically handle temporary 429 errors by retrying failed requests with increasing delays.

How to Implement:

Modify your pytrends initialization to include retries and backoff:
pythonpytrends = TrendReq(hl='en-US', tz=360, retries=3, backoff_factor=0.5)

retries: Number of retry attempts (e.g., 3 total).
backoff_factor: Delays retries exponentially (e.g., 0.5 means ~0.5s after first failure, ~1s after second).


For more control, wrap calls in a try-except with custom backoff:
pythonimport random  # For jitter to mimic human behavior

def fetch_with_backoff(func, *args, **kwargs):
    max_retries = 3
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:  # Catch rate limit errors
            if '429' in str(e) or 'Too Many Requests' in str(e):
                sleep_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.random()  # Exponential backoff with jitter (1-2s, 2-4s, 4-8s)
                time.sleep(sleep_time)
            else:
                raise e
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded due to rate limits.")

# Usage
interest = fetch_with_backoff(pytrends.interest_over_time, kw_list=['keyword'], timeframe='today 5-y')

Why This Works: Directly from pytrends docs—retries handle transient blocks, and backoff prevents hammering the server.
Testing Tip: Log errors in your LED breadcrumbs (e.g., "500 - Rate limit hit, retrying after 5s") for debugging.



3. Use Proxies for IP Rotation (Free Tier Options)
If delays aren't enough (e.g., for higher-volume testing), rotate IP addresses via proxies to distribute requests. Google blocks IPs, not accounts, so this resets the "counter."

How to Implement:

Initialize pytrends with a list of free HTTPS proxies (Google only accepts HTTPS):
pythonproxies = [
    'https://free-proxy1.example.com:8080',
    'https://free-proxy2.example.com:8080',
    # Add 5-10 more
]
pytrends = TrendReq(hl='en-US', tz=360, proxies=proxies, retries=2, backoff_factor=0.1)

Pytrends will cycle through them automatically.


Finding Free Proxies: Use sites like free-proxy-list.net or proxy-list.download (filter for HTTPS, anonymous, and working ones). Test them first:
pythonimport requests
def test_proxy(proxy):
    try:
        response = requests.get('https://www.google.com', proxies={'https': proxy}, timeout=5)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except:
        return False

# Filter a list
valid_proxies = [p for p in proxies if test_proxy(p)]

Why This Works: Bypasses IP-based limits. Users on GitHub report success with 5-10 proxies for sustained querying.
Pros/Cons: Free if you use public lists, but free proxies are unreliable (slow or dead)—check daily. For stability, consider a cheap paid service like BrightData's free trial (~$0 for first 7 days). Ethical note: Stick to Google's ToS; don't abuse for commercial scraping.



4. Other Optimizations and Alternatives

Cache Results: During testing, save query outputs to JSON (e.g., in data/sessions/) and reuse them for repeated runs. Add logic: If file exists, load it; else query.
pythonimport json
import os

cache_file = 'trends_cache.json'
if os.path.exists(cache_file):
    with open(cache_file, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
else:
    # Pytrends call here
    with open(cache_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f)

Reduce Query Volume: In Agent 0, batch keywords (pytrends supports up to 5 per call) to minimize requests. Limit to essential data (e.g., skip regional if not needed).
Monitor and Graceful Degradation: In your error handling (per PRD), retry 3x with backoff, then fall back to partial results (e.g., use only Reddit/YouTube if Trends fails).
Long-Term Alternatives if Limits Persist:

Switch to a paid wrapper like SerpAPI (starts at $50/month for 5,000 queries) for reliable access without limits.
Use unofficial forks of pytrends with built-in proxy support (search GitHub for "pytrends fork rate limit").
For ebooks, rely more on Reddit/YouTube (your MVP sources) and deprioritize Trends if it's the bottleneck.



Recommendations for Your App

Start with #1 and #2 (delays + retries)—test with 10-20 runs to see if it resolves.
If still hitting limits, add proxies (#3).
Update your PRD's "Rate Limiting Strategy" to include these (e.g., 10s delays + backoff).
During beta, this keeps costs at $0 while achieving your 85-90% accuracy target.
