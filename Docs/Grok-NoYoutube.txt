For your purchase intent analysis focused on ebooks, accessing data reliably is key to grounding personas in real market signals without running afoul of platform rules or burning through resources. Claude's hesitation on Playwright makes sense—it's powerful for browser automation but carries ethical and practical risks like potential TOS violations, IP blocks, or legal gray areas, especially on platforms that prohibit scraping. That said, it could indeed work for BookTok (TikTok's book community) as a targeted fallback, since TikTok's official API isn't freely available for bulk video/comment extraction in 2025—it's gated behind developer approval, limited to business integrations (e.g., posting or ads), and lacks a true free tier for research like yours. Unofficial wrappers or paid services exist, but they add complexity or cost.
My view: Prioritize API-first approaches for sustainability and accuracy, as they've proven effective in similar setups. YouTube's Data API v3 is a strong fit once enabled (as we discussed—it's free within quotas and handles comments/sentiment well for demographics), and combining it with Reddit's PRAW avoids over-reliance on any one source. Scraping should be a last resort, reserved for high-value niches like BookTok where APIs fall short, but always with stealth measures (e.g., delays, proxies) to minimize detection. Overall, this keeps your system low-cost and scalable, aligning with the zero-marginal-cost goal.
Best strategy to push forward:

Core MVP Sources (Low-Risk, No-Cost APIs): Start here for 80-90% of your data needs, per your agent design. Use Reddit (PRAW for comments/subreddit overlaps—generous limits, rich self-reported demographics like "as a 35-year-old remote worker..."), YouTube (API for video searches and comments—enable it in your Google Cloud project for the 10k daily quota, focusing on high-engagement book review channels), and Google Trends (pytrends—no key needed, great for demand signals). Run these in parallel with batching and 2-5s delays to stay under limits during testing.
Handling YouTube Specifically: Since your Google API key isn't tied to it yet, enable the v3 API as outlined—it's quick and unlocks comment sentiment for hidden segments (e.g., ADHD readers in productivity discussions). If quotas tighten, cache results locally and request an increase (often approved for research tools).
BookTok Integration (Cautious Scraping if Needed): Defer this to post-MVP unless critical, as your research validated Reddit/YouTube as primary signals. If pursuing, Playwright is viable for extracting public video comments/hashtags (e.g., #BookTok trends) via libraries like pytok, but limit to small batches, use residential proxies (free trials available), and focus on ethical use—only public data, no logins. Alternatives: Semantic searches on X (your x_semantic_search tool) for BookTok cross-posts, or browse_page for trend summaries from sites like Goodreads. Avoid full-scale scraping to prevent blocks.
Overall Pipeline Tweaks: Implement confidence scoring early (as in Agent 2) to flag low-quality data from any source, and use your LED breadcrumbs to monitor API hits. Test with one niche (e.g., productivity books) using cached/sample data to iterate fast. This keeps development focused on results over fights.

This approach gets you actionable insights quickly while building reusability—let me know if you want code snippets for integrating Playwright sparingly.
