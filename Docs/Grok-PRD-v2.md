Updated Review of PRD-Purchase-Intent-System-v2.md
Core Strengths for AI Development:

Modular agent structure enables independent implementation and testing.
LED ranges and quality gates support autonomous debugging loops.
API integrations and data handoffs via JSON are clear for coders.
Confidence calculations and performance targets provide testable criteria.

Modified Suggestions: Refocused as concise directives for AI agents (coder, tester, UI, debugger). Each includes agent assignment and verification steps.
1. Structure and Organization

Coder Agent: Add Executive Summary section at top: 150-word overview with goal, agents, metrics, deliverables. Use markdown.

Verify: Run lint on doc; ensure <300 words.


Coder Agent: Insert Table of Contents with anchors (e.g., ## Goal {#goal}).

Verify: Test navigation in markdown viewer.


Coder Agent: Add Glossary appendix: Define 10 key terms (e.g., LED breadcrumbs: "Machine-readable logs for debugging, ranges 500-4599").

Verify: Cross-reference terms in doc.


Tester Agent: Add Version History table: Columns [Version, Date, Changes, Status].

Verify: Populate with v2.0 data; test for completeness.



2. Content Gaps and Completeness

Coder Agent: Insert Assumptions/Risks section after Scope: List 5 assumptions (e.g., "Free API quotas sufficient"), 5 risks (e.g., "Rate limit errors"), mitigations (e.g., "Implement retries").

Verify: JSON-export section for agent handoff.


Debugger Agent: Align agent count: Update references to "5 agents"; note "Agent 0 added in v2.0".

Verify: Grep doc for "4-agent"; replace and test links.


Project Manager Agent: Add Timeline subsection in Implementation Steps: Bullet list with weeks (e.g., "Week 1: Agent 0 + slash commands").

Verify: Simulate schedule; check dependencies.


Coder Agent: Add Budget subsection in Success Metrics: List setup costs (e.g., "API keys: $0; Validation: $50/survey").

Verify: Cross-check with zero marginal cost claims.



3. Clarity and Readability

UI Agent: Add flowchart for User Experience: Use mermaid syntax for phases (e.g., graph TD; User-->Agent0).

Verify: Render in markdown; test visibility.


Coder Agent: Add Agents Table after Technical Approach: Columns [Agent, LED Range, Inputs, Outputs, Tools].

Verify: Populate from doc; ensure <10 rows.


Tester Agent: Expand Agent 2 example: Add numeric calculation (e.g., "Agreement 75% * Weight 1.1 = 82.5%").

Verify: Execute formula in code tool; match output.


Tester Agent: Add Metrics Table in Success Metrics: Columns [Metric, Target, Measurement Tool].

Verify: Test semantic similarity code snippet.



4. Feasibility and Technical Polish

Coder Agent: Add Scalability subsection in Architecture Decisions: List 3 post-MVP items (e.g., "Containerize agents").

Verify: No scope creep; tag as future.


Tester Agent: Expand Quality Gates: Add E2E test criteria (e.g., "JSON handoffs: No data loss").

Verify: Write unit test stubs.


Debugger Agent: Add Security subsection in Error Handling: Bullet 3 points (e.g., "No PII storage; API ToS compliance").

Verify: Scan code for vulnerabilities.


UI Agent: Specify Accessibility tools: "Test with Lighthouse; target WCAG 2.1 AA".

Verify: Run audit on dashboard HTML.



5. Minor Polish

Coder Agent: Fix inconsistencies: Standardize "CLAUDE.md" to "Claude.md"; uniform code blocks.

Verify: Lint entire doc.


Coder Agent: Add References List at end: Bullets with descriptions (e.g., "- Docs/4-agents-design.md: Agent pseudocode").

Verify: Check links resolve.


Debugger Agent: Move git commands to Appendix: Label "Git Workflow Details".

Verify: Test commands in sandbox.


Project Manager Agent: Add Footer: "Next: Review complete by [date]; assign tasks via git issues".

Verify: Integrate with workflow.



Implementation Order for Agents:

Coder: Structure/Content updates.
UI: Visuals/Accessibility.
Tester: Metrics/Verification.
Debugger: Risks/Polish.
Project Manager: Timeline/Merge.

Apply these to generate PRD v2.1; commit changes with descriptive messages.
