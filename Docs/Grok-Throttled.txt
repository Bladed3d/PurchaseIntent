In this project we have discussed how to obtain data. Seems that only Reddit has no rate limits. But in reality, we don't need every source for every search. Once we help the user choose the top 3 topics of interest, then we can use Youtube, google trends, and other data sources. Did we discuss if there is any access or value in researching data from Ebay or Amazon books? If the app drills down into ideas using Reddit only or perhaps an ai agent just doing online search, then once their top 3 topics of interest are selected, then we could open up rate restricted data sources only to finalize the last few topics. Using this model, how many topics can we research in 12 hours using this approach?Thought for 1m 3sDiscussion on Data Sources: Amazon and eBay for Book Research
Yes, the project documents and chats do discuss access to and value from Amazon data, particularly for books/ebooks, but eBay is not mentioned at all. I'll break this down based on the provided project materials (PRD v2, agent design doc, research findings, and demographic chat), then address your proposed model and the 12-hour estimation.
Amazon Books: Access and Value

Did we discuss it? Yes, extensively. Amazon is highlighted as a valuable but high-risk source in multiple places:

In the research findings (claude-chat-researchdone-01.md): Amazon scraping is noted for gathering reviews, "Customers also bought" data, and Best Sellers Rank (BSR). It's described as "very aggressive" on blocking, requiring 8-10 second delays, stealth mode (e.g., via Playwright library), and backups like ScraperAPI's free tier (1,000 requests/month) to mimic human behavior. The findings recommend prioritizing "Most Helpful" reviews for high-signal data (e.g., demographics like age, occupation from comments like "as a 34-year-old developer..."). However, it's flagged as non-MVP due to complexity and legal/risk concerns—deferred in favor of Reddit and YouTube.
In the 4-agents-design.md: Agent 1 (Product Researcher) explicitly includes Amazon as a medium-priority source using Playwright + stealth for scraping BSR, reviews, and "also bought" lists. It's valued for sales signals (BSR <50,000 indicates strong sellers), review volume (50+ reviews), and semantic similarity matching to your product idea. For books, this could reveal comparable titles like "Deep Work" by Cal Newport, with metadata like price ($17.99), ratings (4.6), and hidden segments via review analysis.
In the PRD-Purchase-Intent-System-v2.md: Amazon scraping is deferred post-MVP due to "higher complexity" and legal risks, with MVP focusing on Reddit, YouTube, and Google Trends. Rationale: Research (in Docs/Grok-Book-data.md, referenced but not provided) validated Reddit/YouTube as primary signals for ebook markets, with Amazon added later for richer data.
In the demographic chat (claude-chat-demographic.md): Amazon is part of the proposed research questions for Phase 1, including scraping BSR, "also bought," and reviews. It's tied to validation methods like triangulation (e.g., compare Amazon reviews to Reddit/YouTube for demographic agreement).


Value for Book/Ebook Research: High, especially for ebooks where Amazon dominates (Kindle store). Key benefits:

Demographics and Intent Signals: Reviews often reveal buyer profiles (e.g., "perfect for busy entrepreneurs"), pain points, and psychographics. BSR correlates with actual sales, helping predict demand.
Comparables and Hidden Segments: "Customers also bought" uncovers adjacent books/topics, similar to subreddit overlap analysis.
Validation: Triangulate with benchmarks (e.g., Pew Research on self-help readers: 58% female) for 75-85% confidence.
Drawback: Not free of risks—blocking is common without timers (as you suggested), and it's ethically gray (Amazon's TOS prohibits scraping, though many tools do it).


Access Methods: No official API for reviews/BSR (unlike Reddit/YouTube). Relies on ethical scraping:

Tools: Playwright (headless browser) with 8-10s delays + user-agent rotation to mimic humans.
Free Tier Limits: ScraperAPI free tier handles 1,000 pages/month without your own proxies.
Your Idea on Timers: Aligns perfectly with recommendations—implement 2-3s delays (as in PRD) or exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s) for retries.



eBay: Access and Value

Did we discuss it? No, eBay isn't mentioned in any of the documents. The focus is on Amazon (for ecommerce/books), Reddit/YouTube (social/discussions), and Google Trends (demand signals). eBay was likely overlooked because it's less relevant for digital ebooks (eBay is more for physical/used goods auctions).
Potential Value: Moderate for physical books, low for ebooks.

Pros: eBay has buyer reviews, "sold" listings, and category data (e.g., search "productivity books" for completed sales prices/volumes). Could reveal niche demand (e.g., rare/used books) or demographics from feedback comments. Tools like Terapeak (eBay's research tool) offer free limited access to sales trends.
Cons: Less review depth than Amazon; demographics harder to infer (shorter comments). Not ideal for ebooks (no Kindle integration). Overlap with Amazon data but with higher noise.
If added: Value in cross-validation (e.g., compare eBay sales ranks to Amazon BSR for triangulation), but not worth the MVP effort given Amazon's superiority for books.


Access Methods: Similar to Amazon—scraping via Playwright or libraries like ebay-scraper (Python). Rate limits/blocking risks apply, so timers (your suggestion) would help. Free API exists for developers (eBay API), but it's limited to 5,000 calls/day and requires app registration—better than scraping but still quota-bound.

If we want to incorporate eBay/Amazon, it fits your "drill down then finalize" model (use them only for top topics to conserve quotas/delays). No major issues beyond standard scraping concerns—we can solve with timers, as discussed.
Your Proposed Model: Drill Down with Unrestricted Sources, Then Restricted for Top 3
This is a smart optimization! It aligns with the project's "start simple" philosophy (from research findings) and MVP scope (defer complex sources). Here's how it maps:

Initial Drill Down (Unrestricted/Low-Limit Sources): Use Reddit (PRAW API, 60 req/min—effectively "no practical limit" for our scale, as you noted) or AI/web searches (e.g., general online queries via tools like web_search or browse_page). Google Trends (pytrends) has no hard limits but suggests delays—it's fast and unrestricted for broad ideation.

Why this works: Reddit alone can generate top ideas via subreddit activity, pain points, and overlap analysis (e.g., r/productivity overlapping with r/ADHD). Skip YouTube initially to save quota.
Time per Initial Topic/Niche: ~2-5 minutes (quick API calls + AI processing). No bottlenecks.


Selection: User/AI selects top 3 from initial results (e.g., via HTML dashboard as in PRD Phase 1).
Finalize with Restricted Sources: For top 3, add YouTube (10,000 quota units/day) and optionally Amazon/eBay scraping. This runs the full Agent 0-4 pipeline (or subsets) with checkpoints.

Bottlenecks: YouTube quota (main limit—assume 500-1,000 units per full topic research: 1-2 searches at 100 units each, plus comment fetches at 1 unit/call). Amazon/eBay: Time-based (delays add 5-10 min per, but no hard quota).



This minimizes waste—full pipeline only for high-potential topics. It also fits the PRD's sequential approach with human checkpoints to approve top 3 before deeper dives.
Estimation: How Many Topics Can We Research in 12 Hours?
Using your model, I'll estimate conservatively based on project specs (e.g., Agent 0 <15 min full, with 2-3s delays). Assumptions:

"Topic" Definition: A full-researched topic/niche (e.g., "productivity for entrepreneurs") via the pipeline, outputting demand scores, comparables, demographics, personas, and intent predictions. Initial drill-down generates candidates, but "researched" means finalized ones.
Batch Process: Research 10-20 candidate topics initially (fast), select top 3, finalize those 3. Repeat batches.
Time Breakdown (per batch):

Initial drill-down (10-20 candidates, Reddit/Google Trends only): 20-40 min (2 min each, sequential; could parallelize to <10 min).
Human/AI Selection: <5 min (as per PRD checkpoints).
Finalize top 3 (full sources: YouTube + optional Amazon/eBay): 30-45 min (10-15 min each, including delays).
Total per Batch: ~1-1.5 hours.


Quotas in 12 Hours:

Reddit: 60 req/min × 720 min = ~43,000 req—plenty (each topic might use 10-20 req).
Google Trends: Effectively unlimited.
YouTube: 10,000 units/day—limits to ~10-20 full topics (500-1,000 units each). This is the main cap.
Amazon/eBay Scraping: No quota, but delays add time (assume 5-10s per page, 10 pages/topic = ~1-2 min extra).
Overall: Time is secondary bottleneck if running sequentially; quotas cap YouTube-heavy finals.



Max Topics Researched (Finalized):

Per batch: 3 finalized topics.
Batches in 12 hours: 8-12 (at 1-1.5 hours each, including buffers for errors/retries).
Total: 24-36 fully researched topics (e.g., 10 batches × 3 = 30).

Why this many? Initials are fast/cheap (handle 100-200 candidates across batches with no quota hit), finals limited by YouTube (10-20 max/day), but 12 hours allows pacing to stay under quota while maximizing batches.
If no Amazon/eBay (MVP mode): Bump to 30-40 (less time per final).
Aggressive Scenario: Parallelize initials (e.g., via code_execution tool batches) → 40+ topics.
Conservative (with human checkpoints/delays): 18-24.



This scales well for ebooks—e.g., start with broad "productivity," drill to 20 ideas, finalize top 3 like "ADHD procrastination." If quotas bind, rotate sources (e.g., skip YouTube for some finals). Let me know if you want to refine assumptions or simulate in code!
