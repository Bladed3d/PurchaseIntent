Based on the available data from web searches, X (Twitter) discussions, and related trends analysis (focusing on 2024-2025 patterns, as 2025-specific data is emerging), I've drilled down from the general topic "meditation" to identify the top 10 most in-demand subtopics for an ebook. Demand is ranked by a composite score derived from:

Frequency of mentions across sources (e.g., Reddit threads, Forbes/Healthline articles, YouTube videos).
Engagement metrics (e.g., likes/reposts on X posts, upvotes on Reddit).
Trend indicators (e.g., rising popularity in wellness reports, search volume proxies from articles).

This avoids direct API calls by relying on pre-fetched web content and social signals, simulating a Claude agent workflow (e.g., sequential data gathering, enrichment loops, and ranking) without rate limits. Subtopics are selected for ebook potential—evergreen, actionable themes with broad appeal (e.g., mental health, sleep, stress relief).

These subtopics show strong demand for practical, mental health-focused content—aligning with 2025 trends like proactive "mental health days" and commoditized mindfulness (e.g., apps, scream clubs as alternatives). For your ebook, prioritize evergreen ones like guided or mindfulness, as they have sustained engagement (e.g., multi-year Reddit streaks). If building Claude agents, model this as: Prompt Agent 1 to fetch/summarize web data (via browse/search tools), Agent 2 to enrich with social signals (X searches), Agent 3 to rank (composite logic in code execution). This chains without APIs, using web proxies/delays internally for scalability.9 𝕏 posts10 web pages1.9sHow do I instruct Claude to do what you did, taking the general topic and finding the top subtopics like you did?Thought for 15sTo instruct Claude (Anthropic's AI, like the one in Claude.ai or their API) to replicate the process I used—drilling down from a general topic like "meditation" into the top 10 in-demand subtopics without relying on rate-limited APIs—you'll need to craft a detailed, structured prompt. Claude excels at following explicit instructions, especially when you break down the task into steps, emphasize ethical/web-based research (to avoid direct API calls), and guide it to use its built-in capabilities or simulate a workflow (e.g., inspired by n8n's modular nodes).
Claude doesn't have the exact same tools as me (e.g., no native "web_search" or "x_keyword_search" like xAI's setup), but it can browse the web, summarize content, and perform logical aggregation if prompted correctly. Focus on prompting it to use web searches, content summarization, and manual scoring based on publicly available signals (e.g., from articles, forums, or social media snippets). This mirrors my approach: gathering data from web/X sources and computing composites without APIs.
Step 1: Key Principles for Your Prompt

Be Explicit and Step-by-Step: Claude performs best with numbered steps, like an n8n workflow (trigger → fetch → enrich → rank → output).
Avoid Rate-Limited APIs: Instruct it to use web browsing or searches for proxies of data (e.g., articles on trends instead of direct Trends API).
Incorporate Composite Scoring: Define how to calculate demand (e.g., based on mention frequency, engagement from summaries).
Handle Outputs: Ask for a ranked list with scores, like my previous response.
Ethical Guardrails: Remind it to use public sources and avoid scraping if not allowed.
Length and Clarity: Keep the prompt concise but comprehensive (500-1000 words) to avoid overwhelming it.

Step 2: Sample Prompt to Give to Claude
Copy-paste this directly into Claude.ai or their API playground. Replace "[GENERAL_TOPIC]" with your topic (e.g., "meditation").
textYou are a research agent tasked with drilling down from a general topic into the top 10 most in-demand subtopics for an ebook, without using any rate-limited APIs like Google Trends, YouTube Data API, or Reddit PRAW. Instead, simulate a workflow like n8n: use web browsing and searches to gather data from public sources (e.g., articles, forums, social media summaries), enrich with engagement signals, compute a composite demand score, and rank them.

General topic: [GENERAL_TOPIC]

Follow these steps exactly, like a modular workflow:

1. **Trigger/Input**: Start with the general topic. Brainstorm 15-25 potential subtopics based on common knowledge or logical extensions (e.g., for "meditation": guided, mindfulness, sleep-related). Do not query external tools yet.

2. **Fetch Data (Web Search Node)**: Use web searches to find recent articles, reports, or lists on trending subtopics. Search queries like: "top [GENERAL_TOPIC] trends 2025 site:forbes.com OR site:healthline.com OR site:reddit.com", "most popular [GENERAL_TOPIC] subtopics 2024-2025", "in-demand [GENERAL_TOPIC] ebook ideas". Limit to 5-10 high-quality sources (e.g., Forbes, Healthline, Reddit threads via search results). Summarize key subtopics mentioned and any engagement metrics (e.g., "this subtopic has 500+ upvotes on Reddit").

3. **Enrich with Social Signals (X/Twitter or Forum Node)**: Browse or search for X (Twitter) discussions or forum threads. Use queries like: "top [GENERAL_TOPIC] techniques 2025" on X, or browse Reddit threads (e.g., url: "https://www.reddit.com/r/meditation/top/?t=year" if topic is meditation). Extract signals like likes, reposts, upvotes, or mention frequency from summaries. For each subtopic, note approximate engagement (e.g., "high: 800+ likes on X posts").

4. **Aggregate and Score (Code/Aggregate Node)**: For each subtopic from steps 1-3:
   - Assign a Trends Proxy Score (0-100): Based on how often it's mentioned in recent articles (high if in multiple 2024-2025 sources).
   - Assign a Reddit/Forum Score (0-100): Normalized from upvotes/mentions (e.g., >500 upvotes = 100).
   - Assign an X/Social Score (0-100): Normalized from likes/reposts (e.g., >500 likes = 100).
   - Compute Composite Demand: (0.5 * Trends Proxy) + (0.25 * Reddit Score) + (0.25 * X Score).
   Deduplicate subtopics and ensure 10-15 unique ones.

5. **Rank and Output (Sort/Output Node)**: Sort the subtopics by composite score descending. Output the top 10 in a formatted list, like:
   - 1. Subtopic Name (Demand Score: XX)  
     Brief explanation of why it's in-demand (from sources), ebook angle.

Use only public web data; do not invent metrics. If data is sparse, note it and prioritize reliable sources. Ensure the process is ethical and avoids any scraping violations.
Step 3: How to Use and Refine This with Claude

Run It: Paste the prompt into Claude.ai. It will execute the "workflow" internally, using its web-browsing capabilities (if enabled in your plan) or simulating based on knowledge.
Iterate: If the output isn't perfect, follow up: "Refine the top 5 subtopics with more details from [specific source URL]."
Model After n8n: This prompt treats Claude like n8n nodes—e.g., Step 2 is "HTTP/Search Node," Step 4 is "Aggregate Node." If Claude has tools (in API mode), you can add: "Use your browse tool for URLs."
Avoid Limits: By relying on web summaries (not APIs), it sidesteps quotas. Claude's internal limits are generous for this.
Customization: For deeper dives, add: "Focus on 2025 trends for [niche audience, e.g., professionals]."

This turns Claude into a rate-limit-free research agent
