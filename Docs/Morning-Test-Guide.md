## Quick Reference Commands

### **Single Topic Research:**
```bash
python agents/agent_0/main.py --method playwright "topic name"
```

### **Multiple Topics:**
```bash
python agents/agent_0/main.py --method playwright \
  "topic1" "topic2" "topic3"
```

### **Drill-Down (Generate Subtopics):**
```bash
python agents/agent_0/main.py --drill-down "topic" --method playwright
```

### **Fallback to PyTrends (if Playwright fails):**
```bash
python agents/agent_0/main.py "topic name"
# (no --method flag = uses pytrends)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Still Getting 429 Errors:**

**Problem:** Rate limits haven't reset yet

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check how long since last test
# Wait another hour
# Or test with previously cached topics:
python agents/agent_0/main.py --method playwright \
  "billionaire romance novels"  # We cached this earlier
```

### **CSV Download Fails:**

**Check LED breadcrumbs:**
```
[OK] LED 574: export_buttons_found, count: ?
```
- If count = 0 ‚Üí Page structure changed (Google updated HTML)
- If count = 4 ‚Üí Buttons found, download issue
- Check `cache/playwright/[topic_name]/` for CSV files

**Solution:** Use fallback to pytrends for that topic

### **Browser Doesn't Launch:**

**Error:** `playwright executable not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### **Parser Errors (LED 580-589):**

**Check specific LED:**
- 581: Interest Over Time parsing issue
- 582: Related Queries parsing issue
- 583: Related Topics parsing issue
- 584: Interest By Region parsing issue

**Solution:** Check CSV file manually in `cache/playwright/` to see format
