YouTube API Removal - System Architecture Decision
====================================================

Date: 2025-10-30
Context: YouTube API quota increase denied by Google

## Decision: Remove YouTube API Entirely

### Rationale

1. **YouTube Quota Denial**
   - Google denied quota increase request
   - Default 10,000 units/day = ~100 searches
   - New Google process makes approval harder
   - Creates friction in research workflow

2. **Better Purchase Intent Signals Without YouTube**
   - **Reddit**: Direct purchase discussions ("Where to buy...", "I'd pay for...")
   - **Google Trends**: Search volume and trend direction
   - **YouTube**: Vanity metrics (views, subscribers) - weak purchase intent signal

3. **Removed Constraints**
   - No API quotas to manage
   - No rate limiting friction
   - Unlimited research iterations
   - Simpler system architecture

### Implementation Changes

**Removed:**
- YouTubeClient class (api_clients.py)
- YouTube scoring methods (scoring.py)
- YouTube competition analysis (competition_analyzer.py)
- YouTube dashboard UI elements (dashboard.py)
- YouTube API credentials (config.py, .env)

**Updated:**
- Scoring weights: 50% Google Trends, 50% Reddit (was 35/35/30)
- Confidence: 2 sources = 100%, 1 source = 60% (was 3/2/1 = 100/70/40)
- Audience size calculation: Increased weights for Trends (150K) and Reddit (2x)
- Reddit insights: Added purchase intent detection

**Code Reduction:**
- Removed: 429 lines
- Added: 98 lines
- Net: -331 lines (cleaner codebase)

### Testing

Verified with "productivity apps" query:
- Composite Score: 98.40
- Confidence: 100% (Reddit + AI Agent data)
- Competition: 69.75 (High)
- Opportunity: 29.77 (Avoid - saturated market)

### Why This Is Better

**Reddit > YouTube for purchase intent:**
- "Best productivity app for ADHD?" ’ Direct problem + solution seeking
- "I'd pay $10/month for X feature" ’ Direct willingness to pay
- High engagement scores ’ Community cares about topic
- Subreddit overlap ’ Adjacent market opportunities

**Google Trends > YouTube for demand:**
- Search volume trends ’ Real demand signals
- Rising/falling trends ’ Market timing
- Geographic data ’ Where to target
- Related queries ’ Adjacent opportunities

**YouTube was:**
- Subscriber counts ’ Brand awareness (not purchase intent)
- View counts ’ Content popularity (not willingness to pay)
- API quotas ’ Research friction
- Maintenance burden ’ Complex error handling

### Future Considerations

If we ever need video content signals:
1. Use RSS feeds (no API key, limited data)
2. Parse public search results (fragile, may break)
3. Focus on Reddit video discussions instead

**Do NOT add YouTube back unless:**
- Google approves unlimited quota (unlikely)
- Strong evidence YouTube signals > Reddit purchase intent (unlikely)
- User explicitly requests and accepts quota friction (ask first)

### Key Takeaway

**You don't need more data sources. You need BETTER data sources.**

Reddit + Google Trends provide stronger purchase intent signals than Reddit + YouTube + Google Trends ever did, with zero API quotas and simpler code.
