# Purchase Intent System - PRD

**Version:** 2.0 - Refined Specification
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Ready for Team Review
**Previous Version:** 1.0 (archived as PRD-Purchase-Intent-System.md)

---

## Changes from v1.0

**Key Refinements Based on Collaborative Review:**

1. **Agent 0 Data Sources Clarified (Question 2)**
   - MVP sources: Reddit (PRAW API), YouTube (YouTube Data API v3), Google Trends (pytrends)
   - All free tier with low technical/legal risk
   - Deferred post-MVP: Amazon scraping, X/Twitter API, TikTok/BookTok (higher complexity)
   - Rationale: Research findings (Docs/Grok-Book-data.md) validated Reddit + YouTube as primary signal sources

2. **Agent 2 Confidence Calculation Methodology Added (Question 5)**
   - Hybrid model: Combines source agreement + data quality weighting
   - <80% confidence triggers checkpoint failure (user must approve to continue)
   - Prevents error propagation to expensive downstream agents
   - Target: 85-90% accuracy vs. human focus groups' 60-70%

3. **Agent 4 Performance Targets Defined (Question 3)**
   - Target runtime: 20-25 minutes (accuracy-first approach)
   - 400 personas × 8 parallel paths = 3,200 perspectives (down from 4,000)
   - Rationale: Diminishing returns analysis shows 400 personas hits optimal accuracy/speed balance

4. **Slash Command Implementation Pattern (Question 4)**
   - Uses Claude Code custom commands (`.claude/commands/*.md` files)
   - Commands expand to prompts instructing Claude to execute Python agents
   - Reuses existing pattern from `end-session.md` and `context-summary.md`

5. **LED Breadcrumb Ranges Confirmed (Question 1)**
   - Purchase Intent System uses ranges 500-4599 (agent-specific blocks)
   - CLAUDE.md will be updated to document system-specific ranges
   - Follows non-overlapping range allocation for autonomous debugging

---

## Goal

Build an AI-powered synthetic focus group system that predicts consumer purchase intent for digital products (ebooks) in minutes at zero marginal cost, achieving 7-12% higher accuracy than human focus groups.

---

## Scope

**Included:**
- CLI-based workflow with slash commands (`/discover-topics`, `/research-products`)
- 5 autonomous agents: Topic Research → Product Research → Demographics → Persona Generation → Intent Prediction
- HTML dashboard with Chart.js visualizations for interactive topic selection
- LED breadcrumb instrumentation (ranges 500-4599) for autonomous debugging
- Human checkpoints for validation between agent runs (with confidence-based failure gates)
- Persona reusability (test unlimited products with same 400 personas)

**Excluded:**
- Web UI or desktop application (CLI only for MVP)
- Real-time collaborative features (single-user sessions)
- API endpoints or SaaS offering (in-house tool only)
- Integration with external CRM/marketing platforms
- Non-ebook product categories (future expansion)

---

## User Experience

### Phase 1: Interactive Topic Discovery

1. User runs: `/discover-topics productivity`
2. **Agent 0** researches demand signals across:
   - **Google Trends** (pytrends library): Search volume trends, regional interest
   - **Reddit** (PRAW API): Subreddit activity, pain point discussions, engagement metrics
   - **YouTube** (YouTube Data API v3): Video view counts, comment sentiment, channel authority
3. HTML dashboard auto-opens in browser showing:
   - Top 5-10 topics ranked by composite demand score
   - Visual charts (bar chart of scores, trend lines showing momentum)
   - Evidence cards for each topic (search volume, community size, content engagement)
4. User clicks preferred topic to select

**Interaction Model:**
- Click-to-select topics (keyboard navigation for accessibility)
- Visual hierarchy: Bar chart (demand scores) + trend line (search volume)
- Performance target: <2 second load, interactive immediately
- Browser support: Chrome/Edge (primary), Firefox/Safari (secondary)

**Deliverable:** `data/sessions/{session_id}/topic-selection.json`

### Phase 2: Automated Research Pipeline

1. User runs: `/research-products "Overcoming Procrastination for ADHD Remote Workers"`
2. **Agents 1-4 run sequentially** with checkpoints:
   - **Agent 1:** Finds 5-10 comparable products (YouTube tutorials, Reddit discussions), discovers hidden segments via subreddit overlap
   - **Checkpoint 1:** User approves comparables
   - **Agent 2:** Extracts demographics (age, occupation, interests) from 500+ reviews/comments, triangulates across 3+ sources
   - **Checkpoint 2:** User approves demographics (confidence target: 80%+, failure if <80%)
   - **Agent 3:** Generates 400 synthetic personas with psychographic conditioning, saves to reusable JSON
   - **Checkpoint 3:** User reviews persona distribution
   - **Agent 4:** Simulates 400 personas × 8 reasoning paths (ParaThinker) = 3,200 perspectives, outputs purchase intent distribution
   - **Checkpoint 4:** User reviews final report

**Deliverable:** `reports/{session_id}/intent-prediction-report.html`

---

## Technical Approach

### 5 Agents

- **Agent 0: Topic Research** (LED 500-599)
  Discovers high-demand ebook topics using Brian Moran's "Rule of One" strategy. Outputs scored topics for user selection.

  **API Implementation Details:**
  - **Google Trends (pytrends)**: Free, no API key required, ~5 second queries
  - **Reddit (PRAW API)**: Free tier (60 requests/minute), requires Reddit app credentials
  - **YouTube (YouTube Data API v3)**: Free tier (10,000 quota units/day), requires Google API key
  - **Rate Limiting Strategy**: Sequential queries with 2-3 second delays between sources
  - **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation (continue with partial results if one source fails)

- **Agent 1: Product Research** (LED 1500-1599)
  Finds comparable products, scrapes reviews/comments, discovers hidden audience segments via Reddit overlap analysis.

  **Data Sources (MVP):**
  - YouTube video comments (YouTube Data API v3)
  - Reddit post comments (PRAW API)
  - Subreddit overlap analysis for segment discovery

- **Agent 2: Demographics Analyst** (LED 2500-2599)
  Extracts customer demographics from text data, triangulates across 3+ sources, calculates confidence scores.

  **Confidence Calculation Methodology:**

  **Hybrid Model = Source Agreement Score × Data Quality Weight**

  1. **Source Agreement Score (0-100%)**
     - Extract demographics from each source (Reddit, YouTube, Google Trends regional data)
     - Calculate overlap: `(Agreed Attributes / Total Attributes) × 100`
     - Example: If Reddit shows "25-34 age" and YouTube shows "25-44", partial agreement = 60%

  2. **Data Quality Weighting**
     - **Sample Size**: <100 comments = 0.7x, 100-500 = 1.0x, >500 = 1.2x
     - **Source Credibility**: Reddit (1.0x), YouTube comments (0.9x), trends data (0.8x)
     - **Recency**: <3 months = 1.0x, 3-12 months = 0.9x, >12 months = 0.7x

  3. **Confidence Score Formula**
     ```
     Confidence = (Agreement Score) × (Avg Quality Weight)

     Example Calculation:
     - Reddit: Age 25-34 (sample: 500 comments, recency: 2 months)
     - YouTube: Age 25-44 (sample: 150 comments, recency: 4 months)
     - Agreement: 60% (partial overlap on age range)
     - Quality Weights: Reddit 1.2× (>500 samples), YouTube 1.0× (100-500 samples)
     - Avg Quality: (1.2 + 1.0) / 2 = 1.1
     - Confidence = 60% × 1.1 = 66% (FAILS checkpoint - <80%)
     ```

  4. **Checkpoint Logic**
     - **≥80% confidence**: Pass checkpoint automatically
     - **<80% confidence**: FAIL checkpoint, display warning to user:
       ```
       ⚠️ Low confidence (67%) - insufficient source agreement
       Sources disagree on: [age range, occupation categories]

       Options:
       1. Gather more data (recommended)
       2. Override and continue (may reduce final accuracy)
       3. Abort and select different topic
       ```
     - User must explicitly approve to continue if <80%

  **Rationale:** Prevents cascade failures. Agent 3 generates 400 personas based on Agent 2's demographics. If demographics are wrong, all downstream work is wasted (45+ minutes lost). Checkpoint gate minimizes risk.

- **Agent 3: Persona Generator** (LED 3500-3599)
  Creates 400 synthetic customer personas with realistic psychographic profiles, saves as reusable asset.

  **Persona Count Optimization:** 400 personas (reduced from 500) based on diminishing returns analysis. Sufficient for statistical significance while improving Agent 4 runtime.

- **Agent 4: ParaThinker Intent Simulator** (LED 4500-4599)
  Simulates purchase intent using 8 parallel reasoning paths (VALUE, FEATURES, EMOTIONS, RISKS, SOCIAL PROOF, ALTERNATIVES, TIMING, TRUST). Uses SSR (Semantic Similarity Rating) for realistic distributions.

  **Performance Targets:**
  - **Target Runtime:** 20-25 minutes (accuracy-first approach)
  - **Computation:** 400 personas × 8 reasoning paths = 3,200 perspectives
  - **Optimization Strategy:**
    - Parallel processing where possible (8 reasoning paths run concurrently per persona)
    - Batch API calls (10 personas per batch to respect rate limits)
    - Early stopping if convergence detected (>95% confidence after 300 personas)
  - **Rationale:** Research shows diminishing returns beyond 400 personas (<2% accuracy gain for 40% more compute). Optimal balance at 400.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create slash command infrastructure** (reuse pattern from `.claude/commands/end-session.md`)
   - `/discover-topics [niche]` → Expands to prompt: "Task Agent: Execute Agent 0 (Topic Research) for niche: [niche]"
   - `/research-products [topic]` → Expands to prompt: "Task Agent: Execute Agents 1-4 sequentially for topic: [topic]"
   - Commands are `.md` files in `.claude/commands/` directory
   - Format: YAML frontmatter + prompt template with `{{placeholder}}` variables

2. **Build Agent 0 with HTML dashboard output** (reuse HTML template pattern if exists, or create minimal Chart.js template)
   - Python script for research logic (`agents/agent_0.py`)
   - Jinja2 template for HTML report (`templates/topic-dashboard.html`)
   - Auto-open browser with `webbrowser.open()`
   - API integration: pytrends (pip), PRAW (pip), google-api-python-client (pip)

3. **Implement LED breadcrumb system** (reuse pattern from `CLAUDE.md` LED ranges)
   - Create `lib/breadcrumbs.py` utility
   - Log to `logs/agent-{N}-breadcrumbs.log`
   - Ranges: Agent 0 (500-599), Agent 1 (1500-1599), Agent 2 (2500-2599), Agent 3 (3500-3599), Agent 4 (4500-4599)

4. **Build Agents 1-4 as Python modules** (modular architecture per `CLAUDE.md`)
   - Each agent: `agents/agent_{N}.py` < 300 lines
   - Data handoff via JSON: `data/sessions/{session_id}/agent{N}-output.json`
   - Checkpoint prompts between agents (Agent 2 checkpoint includes confidence gate logic)

5. **Create autonomous development loop workflow** (git worktrees + quality gates)
   - Lead Programmer → LED Breadcrumbs Agent → Testing Agent → Debug Agent (if needed) → Loop
   - Git worktree per agent for parallel development
   - Quality gates: IMPLEMENTED → INSTRUMENTED → TESTED → VALIDATED → MERGED

### Slash Command Implementation Pattern

**Example: `/discover-topics` Command**

File: `.claude/commands/discover-topics.md`

```markdown
---
name: discover-topics
description: Execute Agent 0 to research high-demand ebook topics
arguments:
  - name: niche
    description: The niche or category to research (e.g., productivity, fitness)
    required: true
---

Task Agent: Topic Research Specialist (Agent 0)

Execute Agent 0 to discover high-demand ebook topics in the {{niche}} niche.

**Requirements:**
1. Query data sources: Google Trends (pytrends), Reddit (PRAW), YouTube (YouTube Data API v3)
2. Calculate composite demand scores for 10-15 candidate topics
3. Generate HTML dashboard with Chart.js visualizations
4. Auto-open dashboard in browser for user selection
5. Save selected topic to: data/sessions/{session_id}/topic-selection.json
6. Log LED breadcrumbs (500-599) to: logs/agent-0-breadcrumbs.log

**API Configuration:**
- Reddit: Use credentials from .env (REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET)
- YouTube: Use credentials from .env (YOUTUBE_API_KEY)
- Google Trends: No API key required (pytrends library)

**Success Criteria:**
- Dashboard loads in <2 seconds
- Top 10 topics displayed with evidence cards
- User can click to select topic
- Selection saved to JSON for Agent 1 handoff
```

When user types `/discover-topics productivity`, Claude receives the expanded prompt with "productivity" substituted for `{{niche}}` and executes Agent 0 accordingly.

### Development Workflow

**Project Manager Orchestration:**

The Project Manager agent (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md`) orchestrates all development using three parallel execution patterns:

1. **Git Worktree Setup** (One-time initialization)
   ```bash
   cd D:\Projects\Ai\Purchase-Intent
   git worktree add ../pi-agent-0 main  # Agent 0: Topic Research
   git worktree add ../pi-agent-1 main  # Agent 1: Product Research
   git worktree add ../pi-agent-2 main  # Agent 2: Demographics Analyst
   git worktree add ../pi-agent-3 main  # Agent 3: Persona Generator
   git worktree add ../pi-agent-4 main  # Agent 4: ParaThinker Simulator
   ```

2. **Autonomous Loop Protocol** (Per Agent in Each Worktree)
   ```
   IMPLEMENTED:   Lead Programmer creates agent code
        ↓
   INSTRUMENTED:  Breadcrumbs Agent adds LED debugging (ranges 500-4599)
        ↓
   TESTED:        Testing Agent validates functionality
        ↓         (If fails → Debug Agent analyzes breadcrumbs → Loop to Lead Programmer)
   VALIDATED:     Manual user acceptance test
        ↓
   MERGED:        Git merge from worktree to main repository
   ```

3. **Parallel Development Patterns**

   **Pattern A: Parallel Implementation Across Agents**
   ```javascript
   // Deploy 5 Lead Programmers simultaneously (one per worktree)
   Task(subagent: "Lead Programmer", desc: "Agent 0", worktree: "../pi-agent-0")
   Task(subagent: "Lead Programmer", desc: "Agent 1", worktree: "../pi-agent-1")
   Task(subagent: "Lead Programmer", desc: "Agent 2", worktree: "../pi-agent-2")
   Task(subagent: "Lead Programmer", desc: "Agent 3", worktree: "../pi-agent-3")
   Task(subagent: "Lead Programmer", desc: "Agent 4", worktree: "../pi-agent-4")
   ```

   **Pattern B: Parallel Instrumentation**
   ```javascript
   // After implementations complete, instrument all 5 agents in parallel
   Task(subagent: "breadcrumbs-agent", desc: "Agent 0 LED", worktree: "../pi-agent-0")
   Task(subagent: "breadcrumbs-agent", desc: "Agent 1 LED", worktree: "../pi-agent-1")
   Task(subagent: "breadcrumbs-agent", desc: "Agent 2 LED", worktree: "../pi-agent-2")
   Task(subagent: "breadcrumbs-agent", desc: "Agent 3 LED", worktree: "../pi-agent-3")
   Task(subagent: "breadcrumbs-agent", desc: "Agent 4 LED", worktree: "../pi-agent-4")
   ```

   **Pattern C: Pipeline Overlap Optimization**
   ```javascript
   // Work on Agent 3 while testing Agent 2 and instrumenting Agent 1
   Task(subagent: "Lead Programmer", desc: "Agent 3 Implementation")
   Task(subagent: "breadcrumbs-agent", desc: "Agent 2 Instrumentation")
   Task(subagent: "testing-agent", desc: "Agent 1 Testing")
   ```

**Quality Gates (Purchase-Intent Specific):**
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Agent code works manually with sample data
  - Agent 0: Discovers topics from test niche
  - Agent 1: Finds comparable products
  - Agent 2: Extracts demographics from sample reviews with confidence calculation
  - Agent 3: Generates 400 test personas
  - Agent 4: Predicts intent with 8-path reasoning in <25 minutes

- **INSTRUMENTED**: LED breadcrumbs added per agent
  - Agent 0: Breadcrumbs 500-599
  - Agent 1: Breadcrumbs 1500-1599
  - Agent 2: Breadcrumbs 2500-2599
  - Agent 3: Breadcrumbs 3500-3599
  - Agent 4: Breadcrumbs 4500-4599

- **TESTED**: Automated tests pass
  - Unit tests for core functions
  - Integration tests for data handoffs
  - LED breadcrumb sequence validation
  - Agent 2 confidence calculation accuracy
  - Agent 4 runtime benchmarks (<25 minutes)

- **VALIDATED**: User acceptance test complete
  - Agent output matches expected format
  - Accuracy meets targets (Agent 2: 80%+, Agent 4: 85-90%)
  - Human checkpoint approval received
  - API rate limits respected (no 429 errors)

- **MERGED**: Code integrated into main branch
  ```bash
  cd D:\Projects\Ai\Purchase-Intent
  git merge --no-ff pi-agent-0/main -m "Merge Agent 0: Topic Research"
  # Repeat for each validated agent
  ```

**Merge Strategy:**
- Merge agents sequentially after VALIDATED status
- Test integration after each merge
- Final system test with all 5 agents together
- Only mark MVP complete when full pipeline works end-to-end

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy:** 85-90% correlation with human survey responses (validate Agent 4 output against PickFu or similar)
   - **Target:** Surpass human focus groups' 60-70% accuracy baseline
   - **Measurement:** Compare purchase intent predictions to actual PickFu survey results (50 respondents minimum)
   - **Validation Method:** Semantic similarity between AI predictions and human responses >85%

2. **Speed:** 35-40 minutes end-to-end (Agent 0: 15 min, Agents 1-4: 20-25 min) vs. 2-4 weeks for human focus groups
   - **Agent 0:** <15 minutes (3 API sources with rate limiting)
   - **Agents 1-4 Combined:** 20-25 minutes (Agent 2 confidence calculation + Agent 4 optimization)
   - **Checkpoint Time:** <5 minutes per checkpoint (4 checkpoints = 20 minutes human time)

3. **Cost:** $0 per test during beta (Claude Code subscription) vs. $5,000-20,000 human focus groups
   - **API Costs:** $0 (all free tiers within quota limits)
   - **Validation Costs:** ~$50 per PickFu survey (for accuracy measurement only)

4. **Persona Reusability:** Test 100+ product variants with same 400 personas (marginal cost = $0)
   - First run: 35-40 minutes (full pipeline)
   - Subsequent runs: 3-5 minutes (Agent 4 only with cached personas)

5. **Hidden Segments Discovered:** Agent 1 identifies at least 2 underserved audience segments per product (via subreddit overlap)

6. **Confidence Gate Effectiveness:** <5% false pass rate (Agent 2 checkpoint incorrectly approves low-quality demographics)
   - Track: Correlation between Agent 2 confidence scores and final Agent 4 accuracy
   - Target: 80%+ confidence demographics → 85%+ final accuracy

---

## Technical Decisions

**Decision 1: Python CLI + Slash Commands (not Skills)**
*Rationale:* Agents require explicit user invocation for control over workflow. Skills would auto-trigger unpredictably. Slash commands provide clear entry points and match Claude Code's native pattern.

**Decision 2: HTML Dashboards with Chart.js (not terminal tables)**
*Rationale:* Visual topic selection is faster and more intuitive than scrolling terminal output. Chart.js is lightweight (no heavy framework). Auto-opens in browser for seamless UX.

**Decision 3: Zero Marginal Cost Model (Claude Code Subscription)**
*Rationale:* Beta deployment as in-house service eliminates per-request API costs. Unlimited testing during development. Optional SaaS pricing post-MVP if scaling beyond personal use.

**Decision 4: LED Breadcrumbs for Autonomous Debugging (500-4599 ranges)**
*Rationale:* Console output is machine-readable, enabling Claude to debug autonomously via grep/log analysis. Non-overlapping ranges isolate failures to specific agents instantly.

**Decision 5: ParaThinker 8-Path Architecture**
*Rationale:* Research shows 7-12% accuracy boost vs. sequential reasoning. Eliminates tunnel vision (70% conformity in human focus groups). Each path is independent, parallelizable.

**Decision 6: Agent 0 MVP Data Sources (Reddit + YouTube + Google Trends)**
*Rationale:* Research findings (Docs/Grok-Book-data.md) validated these as highest signal-to-effort ratio for ebook market. Free tier APIs with low legal risk. Amazon/Twitter/TikTok deferred due to scraping complexity and rate limiting challenges.

**Decision 7: Agent 2 Confidence Gate (<80% = Checkpoint Failure)**
*Rationale:* Prevents cascade failures. If demographics are wrong, all downstream work (Agents 3-4, 25+ minutes) produces invalid results. Early validation minimizes wasted compute and improves final accuracy.

**Decision 8: 400 Personas (not 500) for Optimal Accuracy/Speed Balance**
*Rationale:* Diminishing returns analysis shows <2% accuracy gain beyond 400 personas for 40% more compute. Target runtime of 20-25 minutes achieves accuracy-first goal while maintaining practical usability.
