# PRD v2.0 - Multi-Agent Team Review Summary

**Review Date:** 2025-10-23
**PRD Version:** 2.0
**Review Method:** Curtis-style parallel multi-agent review
**Agents Deployed:** 5 (Lead Programmer, UI Designer, Breadcrumbs Agent, Testing Agent, Project Manager)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**VERDICT: NOT READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

All 5 specialist agents have identified **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES** that must be resolved before development can begin. The PRD has excellent vision and specifications, but contains fundamental architectural conflicts and missing implementation details.

**Overall Readiness:** 60-65%
**Estimated Gap Closure Time:** 1-2 days of focused refinement
**Primary Blocker:** Technology stack mismatch (Python vs. TypeScript)

---

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Resolve Before ANY Implementation)

### 1. TECHNOLOGY STACK MISMATCH ⚠️ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Identified by:** Project Manager, Lead Programmer, Breadcrumbs Agent

**Problem:**
- **PRD specifies:** Python CLI agents (`agents/agent_0.py`, `agents/agent_1.py`, etc.)
- **Project infrastructure has:** React 18, TypeScript, Node.js stack
- **Available agents are:** TypeScript specialists (Lead Programmer, Breadcrumbs Agent configured for React/TypeScript)
- **LED breadcrumb system is:** TypeScript-based (`lib/breadcrumb-system.ts`)

**Impact:** Cannot start implementation without resolving stack conflict.

**Decision Required:**
- **Option A (Python):** Rewrite all agent specifications for Python, create Python-specialized agents
- **Option B (TypeScript):** Rewrite PRD to use TypeScript/Node.js CLI with existing infrastructure
- **Option C (Hybrid):** Keep both (Python agents for backend, TypeScript for dashboards)

**Recommendation:** Human decision required IMMEDIATELY.

---

### 2. AGENT 4 PERFORMANCE CLAIMS ARE MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

**Identified by:** Lead Programmer

**Problem:**
- PRD claims: "20-25 minutes for 3,200 perspectives (400 personas × 8 paths)"
- **Reality check:** 3,200 API calls in 20 minutes = 0.375 seconds per call
- Claude API latency: ~5-10 seconds per complex reasoning request
- **Actual projected time:** 2-4 hours minimum (possibly 8-13 hours if serial)

**Impact:** Core value proposition fails. If runtime is 4 hours instead of 25 minutes, MVP is unusable.

**Questions:**
- Is there Claude Code batch API that bypasses normal rate limits?
- Are we using local models (Ollama)?
- Do 8 reasoning paths share one API call? (not 8 separate calls)

**Recommendation:**
1. Conduct real benchmark: 10 personas × 8 paths, measure actual runtime
2. Revise PRD targets based on real data
3. If runtime is actually hours, reduce persona count or accept longer runtime

---

### 3. LED BREADCRUMB RANGE CONFLICT

**Identified by:** Project Manager, Breadcrumbs Agent

**Problem:**
- **PRD defines:** 500-4599 ranges (Agent 0: 500-599, Agent 1: 1500-1599, etc.)
- **CLAUDE.md defines:** 1000-9099 ranges for Purchase Intent System
- **Breadcrumbs Agent expects:** 1000-9099 ranges
- **Gap ranges:** 600-1499, 1600-2499, etc. are unallocated (non-sequential)

**Impact:** Debugging workflow breaks, grep commands fail, LED infrastructure won't work.

**Recommendation:** Pick ONE range system and update all documentation:
- **Option A:** Use PRD ranges (500-4599), update CLAUDE.md + Breadcrumbs Agent
- **Option B:** Use CLAUDE.md ranges (1000-9099), update PRD with sequential allocation

---

### 4. MISSING DATA SCHEMAS FOR AGENT HANDOFFS

**Identified by:** Lead Programmer, Testing Agent

**Problem:**
- PRD mentions "data handoff via JSON" but provides zero schema definitions
- Unknown structures:
  - What's in `topic-selection.json`? (Agent 0 → Agent 1)
  - What's in `agent1-output.json`? (Agent 1 → Agent 2)
  - What's in `reusable-400.json` (personas)?

**Impact:** Agents cannot communicate. Developers cannot implement data flow.

**Recommendation:** Add "Data Schemas Appendix" to PRD with JSON examples for all 5 handoffs.

---

### 5. NO API CREDENTIALS SETUP DOCUMENTATION

**Identified by:** Lead Programmer

**Problem:**
- PRD mentions "requires Reddit app credentials" and "requires Google API key"
- **Missing:**
  - How to obtain credentials (registration steps)
  - Where to store them (`.env` file format)
  - What variables are required (`REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`)
  - Fallback behavior if credentials missing

**Impact:** Developers cannot implement Agent 0 without this information.

**Recommendation:** Add "Prerequisites & Setup" section with:
- Step-by-step credential acquisition (links to Reddit/YouTube developer portals)
- `.env` template file
- Credential validation strategy

---

### 6. ARCHITECTURE MISMATCH (Python vs. TypeScript)

**Identified by:** Breadcrumbs Agent

**Problem:**
- PRD specifies Python agents but existing LED breadcrumb system is TypeScript/browser-based
- No Python `lib/breadcrumbs.py` specification exists
- LED log format undefined (JSON? Plain text? How does Claude grep it?)
- Autonomous debugging interface not designed for Python

**Impact:** Cannot add LED instrumentation without Python breadcrumb library specification.

**Recommendation:** Create Python breadcrumb library spec with:
- JSON Lines log format
- Session/trace correlation
- Autonomous debugging grep patterns

---

### 7. MISSING AGENTS REQUIRED FOR WORKFLOW

**Identified by:** Project Manager

**Problem:**
- PRD quality pipeline requires **Testing Agent** and **Debug Agent**
- Neither agent exists in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Workflow breaks at TESTED and VALIDATED stages

**Impact:** Quality pipeline automation impossible, must resort to manual testing/debugging.

**Recommendation:**
1. Create `testing-agent.md` specification (unit tests, integration tests, LED validation)
2. Create `debug-agent.md` specification (breadcrumb analysis, error pattern recognition)
3. OR update PRD to remove agent automation (manual testing only)

---

## MODERATE CONCERNS (Should Address During Refinement)

### 8. HTML Dashboard Specification Incomplete

**Identified by:** UI Designer

**Gaps:**
- No visual design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Chart.js implementation details missing (chart types, data structure)
- Evidence card design unspecified (structure, layout)
- Click-to-select interaction model unclear

**Impact:** UI Designer cannot implement dashboard without design guidance.

**UI Designer Recommendation:**
- **MVP Approach:** Build minimal HTML table + radio buttons first
- Test Agent 0 data research logic with simple UI
- Add Chart.js visualizations in iteration 2 after core functionality proven
- Aligns with CLAUDE.md "start simple" principle

---

### 9. Agent 2 Confidence Calculation Edge Cases Undefined

**Identified by:** Lead Programmer

**Missing:**
- Single-source confidence calculation (what if only Reddit returns data?)
- Contradictory data handling (Reddit says "Age 18-24", YouTube says "Age 45-54")
- Partial attribute agreement (1 out of 3 demographics match - is that 33% confidence?)

**Impact:** Agent 2 will crash on common edge cases.

**Recommendation:** Define edge case handling formulas in PRD.

---

### 10. Module Size Constraint Violations

**Identified by:** Lead Programmer

**Problem:**
- PRD states: "Each agent < 300 lines"
- Agent 0 alone requires ~450 lines minimum:
  - Google Trends integration (50 lines)
  - Reddit PRAW integration (80 lines)
  - YouTube API integration (80 lines)
  - Scoring algorithm (60 lines)
  - HTML dashboard generation (100 lines)
  - LED breadcrumbs (30 lines)
  - Error handling (50 lines)

**Recommendation:**
- Allow sub-modules (`agents/agent_0/main.py`, `agents/agent_0/apis.py`)
- OR revise constraint to <500 lines for main agents

---

### 11. Testing Infrastructure Undefined

**Identified by:** Testing Agent

**Missing:**
- No test fixtures (sample API responses, mock data)
- No ground truth demographics for validation
- No performance benchmarking automation
- No API mocking strategy (tests would exhaust free tier quotas)

**Impact:** Cannot validate 80% confidence target or 20-25 min runtime without test infrastructure.

**Recommendation:** Create test infrastructure BEFORE implementation:
- Mock API response fixtures
- Ground truth demographic data (e.g., from PickFu survey)
- Performance benchmark scripts

---

### 12. Checkpoint UI/UX Unspecified

**Identified by:** Lead Programmer

**Problem:**
- How does user approve checkpoints? (CLI prompt? Web dashboard?)
- What data is shown? (Raw JSON? Pretty table? Charts?)
- Can user edit data at checkpoint? (manually adjust demographics if 79% confidence)

**Recommendation:** Specify checkpoint interface (suggest: CLI with pretty-printed tables for MVP)

---

## POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS

**What's Well-Specified:**

1. **Clear Agent Separation** - 5 distinct agents with defined responsibilities
2. **Confidence Calculation Methodology** - Agent 2's hybrid model is well-documented with numeric example
3. **API Selection Rationale** - Free tier APIs with low legal risk (Reddit, YouTube, Google Trends)
4. **Success Metrics Are Measurable** - 85-90% accuracy vs. human baseline
5. **Rate Limiting Strategy** - Sequential queries with 2-3 second delays
6. **LED Breadcrumb Philosophy** - Non-overlapping ranges for autonomous debugging
7. **Checkpoint Failure Gates** - Agent 2's <80% confidence checkpoint prevents cascade failures
8. **Quality Gate Definition** - IMPLEMENTED → INSTRUMENTED → TESTED → VALIDATED → MERGED progression

---

## SYNTHESIS: Common Themes Across Agent Reviews

### Theme 1: **Specification vs. Implementation Gap**
All agents identified the same issue: PRD describes **WHAT** should happen but not **HOW** to build it.

**Examples:**
- "Graceful degradation" mentioned but no specifics on minimum viable data
- "LED breadcrumb instrumentation" mentioned but no log format or library spec
- "Data handoff via JSON" mentioned but no schemas
- "Slash commands" mentioned but no implementation pattern details

### Theme 2: **Missing Prerequisites**
Cannot start implementation without foundational elements:
- API credential setup instructions
- Data schema definitions
- Test fixture library
- LED breadcrumb library (for Python)
- Testing Agent + Debug Agent specifications

### Theme 3: **Performance Claims Need Validation**
Agent 4's "20-25 minutes" claim appears in multiple agent concerns as unrealistic/unsubstantiated.

**Unanimous recommendation:** Conduct real benchmark before committing to performance targets.

### Theme 4: **Stack Alignment Critical**
Every agent flagged the Python vs. TypeScript conflict. This must be resolved FIRST.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USER

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Required Before Implementation)

**1. DECIDE TECHNOLOGY STACK** ⚠️ **BLOCKING DECISION**
- **Option A:** Python (requires creating Python-specialized agents, LED library)
- **Option B:** TypeScript (rewrite PRD to use existing infrastructure)
- **Option C:** Hybrid (Python backend, TypeScript dashboards)

**User must choose before any work can proceed.**

---

**2. CONDUCT AGENT 4 PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK** ⏱️ **2-4 hours**

Test: 10 personas × 8 reasoning paths, measure actual runtime

**If result is < 5 minutes:** Proceed with PRD targets
**If result is 30-60 minutes:** Reduce persona count to 50-100 for MVP
**If result is 2+ hours:** Revise expectations or use local models

---

**3. ALIGN LED BREADCRUMB RANGES** 📋 **30 minutes**

Pick ONE system:
- Use PRD ranges (500-4599) → Update CLAUDE.md + Breadcrumbs Agent
- Use CLAUDE.md ranges (1000-9099) → Update PRD with sequential allocation

---

**4. DEFINE DATA SCHEMAS** 📄 **2-3 hours**

Add appendix to PRD with JSON examples:
- `topic-selection.json` (Agent 0 output)
- `agent1-output.json` (Agent 1 output)
- `agent2-output.json` (demographics)
- `reusable-400.json` (personas)
- `intent-prediction-report.html` structure

---

**5. ADD API SETUP DOCUMENTATION** 🔑 **1-2 hours**

Create "Prerequisites & Setup" section:
- Reddit API credentials (step-by-step registration)
- YouTube Data API key (Google Cloud Console setup)
- `.env` file template
- Credential validation strategy

---

### SECONDARY ACTIONS (Should Address During Refinement)

**6. Specify Checkpoint Interface** (1 hour)
- CLI prompts with pretty-printed tables for MVP
- Defer HTML checkpoint dashboards to post-MVP

**7. Define Agent 2 Edge Cases** (1 hour)
- Single-source confidence formula
- Contradictory data handling
- Partial attribute agreement calculation

**8. Create Test Infrastructure** (4-6 hours)
- Mock API response fixtures
- Ground truth demographic data
- Performance benchmark automation

**9. Clarify Module Architecture** (30 minutes)
- Allow sub-modules OR adjust <300 line constraint

**10. Create Testing + Debug Agent Specs** (2-3 hours each)
- OR update PRD to manual testing/debugging workflow

---

## ESTIMATED GAP CLOSURE TIME

**Critical blockers only:** 6-10 hours
**All recommendations:** 15-20 hours

**Breakdown:**
- Stack decision + documentation: 1 hour
- Agent 4 benchmark: 2-4 hours
- LED range alignment: 30 minutes
- Data schemas: 2-3 hours
- API setup docs: 1-2 hours
- Edge cases + checkpoint UI: 2 hours
- Test infrastructure: 4-6 hours (optional for MVP)
- Agent specs: 4-6 hours (optional if manual workflow)

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**PRD v2.0 Status:** Strong vision, incomplete implementation specification

**Current Readiness:** 60-65% (varies by agent)

**Recommendation:**
1. **STOP** - Do not begin implementation yet
2. **DECIDE** - Technology stack (Python vs TypeScript) immediately
3. **BENCHMARK** - Agent 4 performance with real test
4. **REFINE** - Address 5 critical blockers (6-10 hours)
5. **THEN START** - Begin implementation with PRD v2.1

**Alternative MVP-First Approach:**
If you want to start NOW despite gaps:
1. Build Agent 0 ONLY as proof-of-concept
2. Use simple HTML table (skip Chart.js)
3. Manual testing (skip Testing Agent)
4. Accept runtime ambiguity for Agent 4 (prototype with 10 personas first)
5. Iterate based on real data

This aligns with your "simple implementation now, perfect later" philosophy and avoids 10 hours of PRD refinement before any code is written.
