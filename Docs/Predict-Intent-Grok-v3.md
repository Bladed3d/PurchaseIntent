Predict-Intent-v3: Enhanced AI-Powered System for Customer Response Prediction
Executive Summary
This version 3 development plan synthesizes the strongest elements from the three prior plans (Predict-Intent-GLM.md, Predict-Intent-Grok.md, and Predict-Intent-Sonnet45-v2.0-DevPlan.md) to create a more robust, scalable, and innovative system. The GLM plan provides a high-level business framework with use cases, success metrics, risks, budget, and revenue models. The Grok plan emphasizes technical fidelity to the research paper's Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR) method, with modular architecture and practical challenges. The Sonnet plan offers a detailed, actionable development roadmap with timelines, code examples, database schemas, and API structures.
Key improvements in v3:

Integration of Advanced Techniques: Incorporate fine-tuning with human data for better extrapolation to new features (inspired by HBS research on LLMs for market research) and conjoint analysis for willingness-to-pay (WTP) predictions.
Hybrid Approach: Blend synthetic and real human data for validation, addressing ethical concerns and bias (from 2025 synthetic research report trends).
Multi-LLM Support: Use Grok 4 as the primary model (leveraging xAI's API), with fallbacks to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-4o for robustness and cost optimization.
New Ideas: Add ethical AI governance, real-time A/B testing automation, integration with e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify APIs), and predictive revenue modeling. Support for GANs/VAEs for generating synthetic quantitative data alongside LLM textual responses.
Enhanced Scalability: Cloud-native design with auto-scaling, reduced API costs via batching and caching, and Validation-as-a-Service (VaaS) features for certifying synthetic outputs against human benchmarks.

The system, Predict-Intent-v3, simulates synthetic consumers using LLMs to predict responses (e.g., purchase intent, engagement) for products, books, courses, ads, and landing pages. Based on the 2025 arXiv paper (v1, no updates as of Oct 10, 2025), it achieves ~90% human test-retest reliability with realistic distributions (KS >0.85). Costs are ~100x lower than human surveys, with near-instant results.
Research Foundation
Core Insights from Original Paper

LLMs simulate purchase intent (PI) via SSR: Elicit textual responses, map to Likert scales using embedding similarities.
Tested on 57 surveys (9,300 responses); recovers distributions and relative appeal.
Demographic conditioning improves realism, especially for age/income.

Updates from Latest Research (as of Oct 10, 2025)

No updates to the arXiv paper (v1).
HBS Working Paper (2025): LLMs excel in conjoint simulations for WTP; fine-tuning with prior human data enhances alignment for new features in the same category but struggles with demographic heterogeneity. Baseline models provide realistic averages; distributional querying (multiple responses per prompt) captures variation.
State of Synthetic Research 2025 Report: Market growth to $4.6B by 2032; emphasizes hybrid synthetic-traditional research, AI personas (digital twins), and tools like Delve AI for persona generation. Trends: "Death of surveys" for low-risk uses; VaaS for bias audits; augmented synthetic methods using small real samples to fine-tune models.
HBR Article (Jul 2025): Gen AI simulates "synthetic customers" for early-stage idea narrowing, reducing time/cost.

These inform v3's focus on fine-tuning, hybrid validation, and ethical governance to mitigate hallucinations and bias.
System Components
Combining modules from all plans for a comprehensive architecture:
1. Content Analysis Engine (from GLM + Sonnet)

Parse inputs: Text, images, URLs, videos (using vision LLMs like GPT-4o).
Extract features: Value propositions, tone, CTA strength, curriculum structure.
New: Multimodal support for ads/landing pages (e.g., OCR + visual analysis).

2. Synthetic Consumer Generator (from Grok + GLM)

Create personas: Demographics (age, gender, income, ethnicity, location), psychographics (values, pain points), behaviors (shopping habits).
Generate dynamically via LLMs; store in database for reuse.
New: Augmented generation – start with small user-provided human data to fine-tune personas; simulate heterogeneity via distributional prompting (50-150 responses per scenario).

3. Elicitation and Intent Prediction Module (from Grok + Sonnet)

Prompt LLMs as personas to generate textual responses (avoid direct Likert to prevent narrow distributions).
Strategies: SSR (core, with multiple anchor sets), FLR (fallback), DLR (for quick tests).
Adapt for types: Purchase/read/enroll/click intent; add conjoint for WTP (e.g., "Choose between options A/B or none").
New: Fine-tuning pipeline – users upload prior survey data; system fine-tunes (via xAI/OpenAI APIs) for category-specific accuracy.

4. Rating Mapping and Analysis Module (from Grok)

SSR implementation: Embed responses (e.g., text-embedding-3-small), cosine similarity to anchors, normalize to pmf.
Aggregate: Mean PI, distributions, KS similarity, Pearson correlation, subgroup analysis.
Qualitative: Topic modeling (BERTopic), sentiment extraction.
New: Conjoint utilities/WTP estimation via multinomial logit (using statsmodels); predictive modeling for revenue/ROI.

5. Testing Framework (from GLM + Sonnet)

A/B/multivariate testing, longitudinal tracking, competitive benchmarking.
New: Real-time automation – webhook integrations for live campaigns; hybrid mode blends synthetic + real data (e.g., validate with small human panels via APIs like Prolific).

6. Output and Reporting (from Grok + Sonnet)

Dashboards: Visualizations (Recharts/Plotly), reports (Markdown/PDF/CSV).
Insights: Recommendations, top quotes, objections/motivators.
New: Ethical audit reports (bias scores, hallucination checks); VaaS certification.
