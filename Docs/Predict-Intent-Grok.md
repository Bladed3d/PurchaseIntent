Predict-Intent-Grok: AI-Powered System for Predicting Customer Responses
Introduction
This plan outlines the development of an AI-powered system, Predict-Intent-Grok, inspired by the research paper "LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings" (arXiv:2510.08338v1). The paper demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate synthetic consumers to predict purchase intent (PI) with high accuracy (up to 90% correlation attainment with human data) while maintaining realistic response distributions. It addresses limitations of direct numerical elicitation by using Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR), where LLMs generate textual responses that are mapped to Likert scales via embedding similarities.
The system will extend this approach beyond personal care products to test a broader range of items: physical/digital products, books, course materials, advertising campaigns, and landing pages. The goal is to predict how target customers might respond in terms of intent (e.g., purchase, engagement, satisfaction) without the high costs and biases of traditional surveys. By simulating diverse personas, the system will provide quantitative metrics (e.g., mean intent scores, distributions) and qualitative feedback (e.g., reasons for ratings).
Key benefits:

Scalable: Simulate thousands of responses quickly.
Cost-effective: Reduces need for human panels.
Versatile: Adaptable to different testing scenarios.
Insightful: Combines stats with natural language explanations.

System Objectives

Predict Responses: Generate synthetic customer feedback on intent metrics (e.g., "How likely are you to buy/read/enroll/click?").
Target Demographics: Condition simulations on user-defined personas (e.g., age, gender, income, location, interests).
Output Types:

Quantitative: Likert-scale distributions, mean scores, correlation with benchmarks (if available).
Qualitative: Aggregated themes from textual responses (e.g., pros/cons).


Applications:

Products: Purchase intent.
Books: Reading interest or recommendation likelihood.
Course Materials: Enrollment intent or perceived value.
Advertising: Engagement or click-through intent.
Landing Pages: Conversion intent (e.g., sign-up likelihood).



System Architecture
The system will be built as a web-based or API-driven application, using Python for backend logic, with integrations for LLMs and embeddings. High-level components:

User Interface/Input Module:

Web app (e.g., Streamlit or Flask) for uploading test items.
Inputs:

Item description: Text, images, URLs (e.g., product specs, book summary, ad copy, landing page screenshot/URL).
Target audience: Demographics (age range, gender, income, ethnicity, location) and psychographics (interests, pain points).
Test type: Select from presets (e.g., "purchase intent," "engagement intent") or custom questions.
Sample size: Number of synthetic responses (default: 100–500 for statistical reliability).
Scale: Likert (e.g., 5-point: "Definitely not" to "Definitely yes") or custom.




Persona Generation Module:

Generate synthetic consumers based on inputs.
Use LLMs to create diverse personas if not fully specified (e.g., "Generate 200 personas matching 25–35-year-old urban professionals with interest in tech").
Draw from paper's approach: Condition prompts with demographics to mirror human biases (e.g., age/income influence on intent).
Store personas in a database (e.g., SQLite) for reuse or auditing.


Elicitation Module:

Prompt LLMs to impersonate personas and respond to the test item.
Strategies from the paper:

Avoid direct Likert: Leads to narrow distributions.
Use textual elicitation: "As a [persona], how do you feel about this [item]? Explain briefly."
Models: GPT-4o or Gemini-2.0-flash (as tested in paper), with temperature ~0.5 for consistency.
Handle multimodal inputs: Use vision-capable LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) for images/landing pages.


Adapt prompts for item types:

Products/Books: "How likely would you be to purchase/read this?"
Courses: "How interested are you in enrolling in this course?"
Ads/Landing Pages: "How likely would you click or convert after seeing this?"


Batch processing: Generate responses in parallel via API calls (e.g., OpenAI/Gemini APIs).


Rating Mapping Module (SSR Implementation):

Core innovation from the paper: Map textual responses to scales via semantic similarity.
Steps:

Embed responses using a model like OpenAI's "text-embedding-3-small".
Define reference statements (anchors) for each scale point (e.g., for 5-point Likert):

1: "I would definitely not buy this; it doesn't appeal to me at all."
3: "I'm neutral; it might be okay but I'm not excited."
5: "I would definitely buy this; it's exactly what I need."


Compute cosine similarity between response embedding and each anchor.
Normalize similarities to create a probability distribution (pmf) over the scale.
Average over multiple anchor sets (as in paper, e.g., 6 sets) for robustness.


Alternatives/Fallbacks:

Follow-up Likert Rating (FLR): If SSR underperforms, use a secondary LLM prompt to map text to numbers.
Custom scales: For non-purchase intent (e.g., "relevance" as tested in paper).




Analysis and Aggregation Module:

Aggregate responses:

Compute mean intent (PI), standard deviation, distributions.
Use metrics from paper: Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) similarity for distribution match (if benchmark data provided), Pearson correlation for ranking multiple items.
Subgroup analysis: Stratify by demographics (e.g., intent by age group, as in Fig. 4 of paper).


Qualitative insights:

Cluster textual responses using embeddings or topic modeling (e.g., via scikit-learn or BERTopic).
Extract themes: Positive/negative sentiments, specific features mentioned.


Visualization: Charts (e.g., histograms for distributions, scatter plots for correlations) using Matplotlib/Plotly.


Output/Reporting Module:

Generate reports in Markdown/PDF.
Include: Summary stats, visualizations, top quotes, recommendations (e.g., "Improve X based on low intent from Y demographic").
Export data: CSV for further analysis.



Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Research and Prototyping (2–4 weeks)

Review full paper appendices (e.g., prompt examples in App. A.4, reference sets in App. C.1).
Set up environment: Python 3.12+, libraries (openai, google-generativeai, sentence-transformers, numpy, pandas, matplotlib).
Prototype SSR: Test on sample data from paper (e.g., simulate personal care surveys).
Validate: Compare with paper results (aim for KS > 0.85, correlation attainment > 80%).

Phase 2: Core Development (4–6 weeks)

Build modules as described.
Integrate APIs: OpenAI for embeddings/LLMs, Google for Gemini.
Handle edge cases: Multimodal (images), long texts (books/courses).
Adapt for item types: Create prompt templates and anchor sets per category.

Phase 3: Testing and Iteration (2–4 weeks)

Internal testing: Run on real-world examples (e.g., test a book summary vs. human feedback).
Metrics: Use paper's success criteria (distributional similarity, relative appeal).
User testing: Simulate A/B tests (e.g., two ad variants).
Optimize: Tune temperatures, anchor sets; experiment with models.

Phase 4: Deployment and Scaling (2 weeks)

Deploy as web app (e.g., on Heroku/AWS).
Add features: Batch processing, API endpoints for integration.
Security: Anonymize personas, rate-limit API calls.

Tech Stack

Backend: Python/Flask.
LLMs: GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash.
Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small.
Data: Pandas for handling responses.
UI: Streamlit for quick prototyping.

Potential Challenges and Solutions

Unrealistic Distributions: As noted in paper, direct elicitation fails. Solution: Strictly use SSR/FLR.
Bias in LLMs: Models may not perfectly mirror demographics. Solution: Fine-tune if needed (paper mentions zero-shot works well); validate against diverse benchmarks.
Cost: API calls for large samples. Solution: Optimize batching; use cheaper models for initial tests.
Generalization: Paper focuses on purchase intent. Solution: Test SSR on other metrics (e.g., relevance, as in paper's additional results); create domain-specific anchors.
Ethical Concerns: Synthetic data isn't real; avoid over-reliance. Solution: Disclaimer in reports; combine with small human validations.
Multimodal Handling: For ads/landing pages. Solution: Use vision LLMs; extract text from images if needed.

Future Enhancements

Integration with real surveys: Hybrid mode (blend synthetic + human data).
Advanced Analytics: Predict revenue impact based on intent scores.
Multi-Language: Extend to non-English demographics.
A/B Testing Automation: Compare variants automatically.

This plan leverages the paper's SSR method as a foundation, scaling it to a practical tool for creators and marketers. Estimated total timeline: 10–18 weeks for MVP.
