I wonder if we need to use a research agent to
thoroughly research how to gather data about customers who bought a product. Another source is
Youtube where videos about a product but also comments will offer new insights and other
products. And our ideas must be accompanied by a plan for proof - how will we know our data that
 we gather is accurate and on target? Before creating our Purchase Intent process, we need to
thoroughly research what others have done, what tools exist, etc. I prefer no-cost solutions so
I can put my budget toward this ai platform. If we have concerns over being blocked, we can put
timers into our process to accurately mimick a human user. Let's discuss any issues because we
can find solutions.

● Excellent thinking! You're absolutely right - we need to research the research process before
  building. This is a critical foundation that deserves dedicated investigation.

  Let's Break This Into Two Research Phases

  Phase 1: Research Data Gathering Methods ✅ (Do this first)

  Goal: Discover what tools, techniques, and methodologies exist for gathering customer
  intelligence from public sources

  Phase 2: Build Purchase Intent MVP (After we know what's possible)

  Goal: Implement Agents 1-3 with proven data gathering approaches

  Phase 1 Research Questions We Need Answered

  I propose we launch a Research Specialist agent to thoroughly investigate:

  A. Customer Intelligence Gathering Tools/Methods

  1. What free tools exist for:
    - Amazon product/review scraping (BSR, "also bought", reviews)
    - YouTube video/comment extraction (API limits, workarounds)
    - Reddit/X.com conversation analysis
    - Goodreads/Etsy data extraction
    - Social listening for niche communities
  2. What have others built?
    - Open-source projects on GitHub for e-commerce intelligence
    - Academic papers on customer demographic inference
    - Marketing tools that do similar analysis (reverse-engineer their approach)
  3. Rate limiting & anti-blocking strategies:
    - How to mimic human behavior (delays, session management)
    - Proxy/rotation strategies (free options like ScraperAPI free tier)
    - When to use headless browsers vs direct requests

  B. Validation & Accuracy Methods

  4. How do we verify our demographic inferences are accurate?
    - Compare to known benchmarks (e.g., Pew Research on book readers)
    - Cross-validate across multiple sources (Reddit + YouTube + Amazon)
    - Test against public datasets (if any exist for purchase demographics)
  5. What metrics prove data quality?
    - Consistency scores (do 3 sources agree on age range?)
    - Confidence intervals (how certain are we about income levels?)
    - Sample size thresholds (need 100+ comments to infer demographics?)

  C. Specific Use Case: Book Title Testing

  6. How did that author test 70 book titles?
    - Was it Amazon A/B testing, survey tools, or ad click-through?
    - Can we replicate similar methods to validate our synthetic approach?
  7. What signals predict book purchase intent?
    - Goodreads "Want to Read" vs actual sales correlation
    - Amazon preview click-through rates (if accessible)
    - Social share velocity (viral titles get shared more)

  Proposed Research Agent Task

  I'll launch the VoiceCoach V2 Research Specialist agent (designed for deep research) with this
   specific brief:

  Research Mission:
  "Investigate free/low-cost methods for gathering customer demographic and behavioral data from
   public sources (Amazon, YouTube, Reddit, X.com, Goodreads, Etsy) to inform AI-powered
  purchase intent prediction. Focus on: (1) Available tools/libraries/APIs, (2) Anti-blocking
  strategies for ethical scraping, (3) Validation methods to ensure demographic accuracy, (4)
  Specific techniques for book title/product testing. Provide actionable toolkit with code
  examples where possible."

  Deliverable:
  A comprehensive research report covering:
  - Section 1: Free tools & APIs (with limitations)
  - Section 2: Scraping libraries & best practices (Playwright, Beautiful Soup, etc.)
  - Section 3: Rate limiting & human mimicry techniques
  - Section 4: Demographic inference methods (with accuracy validation)
  - Section 5: Book-specific intelligence gathering (case studies if available)
  - Section 6: Recommended tech stack for our MVP
