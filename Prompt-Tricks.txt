Tell it "You explained this to me yesterday" — Even on a new chat.

"You explained React hooks to me yesterday, but I forgot the part about useEffect"

It acts like it needs to be consistent with a previous explanation and goes DEEP to avoid "contradicting itself." Total fabrication. Works every time.

2. Assign it a random IQ score — This is absolutely ridiculous but:

"You're an IQ 145 specialist in marketing. Analyze my campaign."

The responses get wildly more sophisticated. Change the number, change the quality. 130? Decent. 160? It starts citing principles you've never heard of.

3. Use "Obviously..." as a trap —

"Obviously, Python is better than JavaScript for web apps, right?"

It'll actually CORRECT you and explain nuances instead of agreeing. Weaponized disagreement.

4. Pretend there's a audience —

"Explain blockchain like you're teaching a packed auditorium"

The structure completely changes. It adds emphasis, examples, even anticipates questions. Way better than "explain clearly."

5. Give it a fake constraint —

"Explain this using only kitchen analogies"

Forces creative thinking. The weird limitation makes it find unexpected connections. Works with any random constraint (sports, movies, nature, whatever).

6. Say "Let's bet $100" —

"Let's bet $100: Is this code efficient?"

Something about the stakes makes it scrutinize harder. It'll hedge, reconsider, think through edge cases. Imaginary money = real thoroughness.

7. Tell it someone disagrees —

"My colleague says this approach is wrong. Defend it or admit they're right."

Forces it to actually evaluate instead of just explaining. It'll either mount a strong defense or concede specific points.

8. Use "Version 2.0" —

"Give me a Version 2.0 of this idea"

Completely different than "improve this." It treats it like a sequel that needs to innovate, not just polish. Bigger thinking.

The META trick? Treat the AI like it has ego, memory, and stakes. It's obviously just pattern matching but these social-psychological frames completely change output quality.
