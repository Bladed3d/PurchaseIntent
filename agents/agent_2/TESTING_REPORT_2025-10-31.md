## Confidence Calculation Validation

### Formula Verification
```
Formula: Confidence = (Source Agreement × 40%) + (Sample Size × 30%) + (Benchmark Match × 30%)

Test Case: 15 data points, 3 sources, no benchmark

Calculation:
  - Source Agreement: 1.0 (100% alignment across sources)
  - Sample Size Score: 0.05 (15/300 minimum = 5%)
  - Benchmark Match: 0.0 (no benchmark provided)

  Confidence = (1.0 × 0.40) + (0.05 × 0.30) + (0.0 × 0.30)
             = 0.40 + 0.015 + 0.0
             = 0.415 (41.5%)

Expected: 0.415
Actual: 0.415
Match: ✅ EXACT
```

### Source Agreement Calculation
```
Amazon Demographics:
  - Primary age: millennial (75%)
  - Primary occupation: entrepreneur (50%)

Reddit Demographics:
  - Primary age: millennial (75%)
  - Primary occupation: entrepreneur (40%)

YouTube Demographics:
  - Primary age: millennial (80%)
  - Primary occupation: entrepreneur (66.7%)

Alignment Score: 1.0 (100%)
✅ All three sources agree on millennial + entrepreneur
```

### Sample Size Score Calculation
```
Total data points: 15
Minimum required: 300

Sample size ratio: 15 / 300 = 0.05 (5%)
Capped at 1.0 (cannot exceed 100%)

Score: 0.05 ✅ CORRECT
Impact: Major (low sample size impacts confidence)
```

### Confidence Threshold Check
```
Threshold: 0.80 (80%)
Calculated: 0.415 (41.5%)
Meets threshold: NO ❌

Expected behavior: Prompt user for approval
Actual behavior: ✅ USER CHECKPOINT TRIGGERED
```
